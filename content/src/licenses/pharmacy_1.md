notesMd: "Note: An issue with naming and a possible collision. There already
  exists a Pharmacy renewal, and the naming is based on the Industry ID, which
  also creates the URL slug. This task is for a CDS renewal for a pharmacy, but
  I currently can't differentiate this between the pharmacy permit renewal."
urlSlug: pharmacy
previewType: renewal
summaryDescriptionMd: You can renew your license 60 days before it expires and
  up to 30 days after expiration. If you fail to renew your license at this
  point, your license will be suspended and you won't be able to provide your
