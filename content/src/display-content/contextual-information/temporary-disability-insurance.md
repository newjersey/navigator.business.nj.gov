The Temporary Disability Benefits Law protects against wage loss suffered because of the inability to perform regular job duties due to illness or injury. Employers are required to pay disability insurance taxes and to give the [Division of Temporary Disability Insurance](https://www.myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/tdi/index.shtml#PrivatePlan) certain information about your employees when they file claims for disability benefits. Your rate is the same for all employees. Employers may select coverage under the state plan or a private plan.
