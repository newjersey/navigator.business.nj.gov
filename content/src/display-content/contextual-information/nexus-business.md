A nexus business is an out-of-state business (also known as a foreign business) that has operations in New Jersey. If any of the following scenarios apply to you, you are a nexus business:

- You have an office in New Jersey, an employee or independent contractor representing your company in New Jersey
- You have property including inventory housed in a 3rd party warehouse in New Jersey
- You have company-operated vehicles making business-related stops (deliveries or pickups) in New Jersey
- Some licensing agreements with an entity operating in NJ

If you are unsure if you are a Nexus business the [NJ the Division of Taxationâ€™s Nexus Unit - Office Audit Branch](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/organization/audit-taxtype-nexus.shtml) can help make that determination.
