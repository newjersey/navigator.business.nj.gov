You can reserve a business name with the New Jersey Department of Treasury.

Names are reserved for six months, **BUT YOU WILL NOT be able to register online with that business name until the six months expire.** Once you reserve your business name, you can only form with that name by submitting a paper application or waiting for the six months reservation to expire.

Alternatively, you can form your business now, and set the `effective date|effective-date` for some point in the future.

I'd like to continue on and [reserve my business name](https://www.njportal.com/dor/businessamendments).
