You can reserve a business name with the New Jersey Department of Treasury. Names are reserved for six months, **and you WILL NOT be able to register that business name online until the six months expire.** Once you reserve your business name, you can only register the name by submitting a paper application or waiting for the six months reservation to expire.

Alternatively, you can form your business now, and set the \`effective date|effective-date\` for some point in the future.
