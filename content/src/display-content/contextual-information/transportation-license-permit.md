If your business often delivers alcoholic beverages, consider getting a transportation license or permit. You can apply for one with the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).

* **Transportation license** lets your business deliver alcohol in and out of the State
* **Limited transportation permit** lets your business transport alcohol not meant to be delivered, sold, or used in the State

You also need to get an insignia. An insignia is a marker on a vehicle that shows it is allowed to carry alcohol.

To see which license, permit, or insignia you need, contact ABC at (609) 984-2830.
