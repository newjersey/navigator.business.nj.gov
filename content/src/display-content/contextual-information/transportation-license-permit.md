If your business often delivers alcoholic beverages, you should get a transportation license or permit.

The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) issues two types:

* **Transportation license**: lets your business deliver alcohol in and out of the State
* **Limited transportation permit**: lets your business transport alcohol not meant to be delivered, sold, or used in the State

Both require you to get an insignia. An insignia is a marker on a vehicle that shows it is allowed to carry alcohol.

To see which license, permit, or insignia you need, contact ABC at (609) 984-2830.
