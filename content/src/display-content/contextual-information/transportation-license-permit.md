If your business often delivers alcoholic beverages, consider getting a transportation license or permit. You can apply for one with the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).

* **Transportation license**: Lets your business deliver alcohol into, out of, through, and within the State of New Jersey
* **Limited transportation permit**: Allows your business to pick up alcohol at points in New Jersey and transport to points outside of New Jersey

You will also need to get an insignia. An insignia is a decal on a vehicle that shows it is allowed to carry alcohol.

To see which license, permit, or insignia you need, contact ABC at (609) 984-2830.
