If your business often delivers alcoholic beverages, consider getting a transportation license or permit. You can apply for one with the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC):

* **Transportation license** lets your business deliver alcohol both into and out of New Jersey
* **Limited transportation permit** allows your business to pick up alcohol at points in NJ and transports to points outside of NJ

You will also need to get an insignia. An insignia is a marker on a vehicle that shows it is allowed to carry alcohol.

To see which license, permit, or insignia you need, contact ABC at (609) 984-2830.
