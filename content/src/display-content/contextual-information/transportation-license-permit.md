If your business regularly delivers alcoholic beverages, consider getting a transportation license or permit. You can apply for one with the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).

You will also need to get an insignia. An insignia is a decal on a vehicle that shows it is permitted to carry alcohol.

To see which license, permit, or insignia you need, contact ABC at (609) 984-2830.
