A marketplace seller is a person or business that sells products through someone else's online store or platform. For example, if you sell your products on Etsy or Amazon, then you are a marketplace seller.

If you only sell through marketplace websites and not on your own, the marketplace facilitator

 `|marketplace-facilitator` 

 usually collects and sends the sales tax for you.
