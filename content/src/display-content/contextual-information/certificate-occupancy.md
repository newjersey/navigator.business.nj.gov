## Certificate of Approval

A Certificate of Approval (CA) indicates if a rented unit or building is safe for occupancy and indicates it's allowable use. A CA is required if your unit was renovated, altered, or if there was a change in use (for example, before the unit was used as a nail salon and now it is a restaurant).

## Certificate of Occupancy

A Certificate of Occupancy (CO) indicates if a building is safe for occupancy AND indicates it's allowable use. A CO is required if this is a new building.
