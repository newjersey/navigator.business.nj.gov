A Certificate of Approval (CA) indicates if a rented unit or building is safe for occupancy and in what capacity it can be used. A CA is required if your unit was renovated, altered, or if there was a change in its use (for example, a unit that used to be a nail salon and is now a restaurant).

### Certificate of Occupancy

A Certificate of Occupancy (CO) indicates if a building is safe for occupancy AND in what capacity it can be used. A CO is required for new buildings.
