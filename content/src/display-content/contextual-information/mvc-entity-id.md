An Entity ID Number (formerly known as Corp. Code) is a 15-digit number issued upon request by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC). You need an Entity ID from MVC if your business operates commercial passenger vehicles and it will be required in all documentation you submit to the MVC.

**Important:** The 15-digit Entity ID number issued by MVC will only be used and requested by the MVC and is a different number from the EIN issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and the Entity ID number issued by the New Jersey Department of Treasury.
