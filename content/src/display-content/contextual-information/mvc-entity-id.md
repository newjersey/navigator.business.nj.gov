A Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) Entity Identification Number (EIN) is a 15-digit number that identifies a business in New Jersey's motor vehicle system. The MVC EIN, once called the Corporation Code (Corpcode), is only for business motor vehicle activities.

The MVC EIN is different from the 9-digit [federal Employer Identification Number (EIN)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/employer-identification-number). The IRS issues the EIN for tax purposes. 

You need an MVC EIN to register and title vehicles under your business name. It is also required to get licenses for vehicle-related businesses.
