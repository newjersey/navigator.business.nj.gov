An Entity ID Number (formerly known as Corp. Code) is a 15-digit number issued upon request by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC). You need an Entity ID from MVC if your business operates commercial passenger vehicles. 

The Entity ID number issued by MVC is different than the EIN issued by Internal Revenue Service and is used for different purposes.
