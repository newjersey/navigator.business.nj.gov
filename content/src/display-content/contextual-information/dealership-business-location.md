To sell new and used motor vehicles, you must have an established business location. The NJ MVC defines a valid business location as one that includes: 
* An office space of 8 to 9 square feet containing a desk, chair and landline telephone
* A safe for motor vehicle documents
* A display case capable of showcasing at least 2 vehicles
* A permanent exterior sign that can be seen from at least 50 feet away
