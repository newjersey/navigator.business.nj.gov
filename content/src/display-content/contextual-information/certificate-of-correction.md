A Certificate of Correction is a form you can file with the New Jersey Division of Revenue & Enterprise Services (DORES).  Use this document if you made an error on your business formation documents. It is different from a Certificate of Amendment.

&nbsp;

#### How is a Correction different from an Amendment?

**Correction:** fix an error or typo made when you first completed the business formation paperwork

**Amendment:** update information if something changed later (for example, a new address, new owner, or name change)

If you’re unsure about which is right for you, ask an attorney or [DORES](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/revenue/revgencode.shtml).

&nbsp;

#### What are some examples of Corrections?

File a Certificate of Correction if you:

* Misspelled your business name on the Certificate of Formation
* Typed a registered agent’s name or address incorrectly
* Entered the wrong date your business formed
