### S-Corporation

S corporations are entities that choose to pass corporate income, some losses, deductions, and credits to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns to be assessed at their individual income tax rates. 

The process for becoming a S corporation is twofold: you will need to file for an S corporation designation at the federal level and then with the State of New Jersey. They are separate processes with different applications, and your business will need an S corporation designation at both levels in order to file taxes correctly and avoid any potential fees associated with an incorrect tax filing.
