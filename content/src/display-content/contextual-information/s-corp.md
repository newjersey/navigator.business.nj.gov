### S-Corporation

S corporations are entities that choose to pass corporate income, some losses, deductions, and credits to their shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns to be assessed at their individual income tax rates. 

To qualify for S corporation status, the corporation must meet the following requirements:

    Be a domestic corporation
    Have only allowable shareholders
    May be: individuals, certain trusts, and estates
    May not be: partnerships, corporations or non-resident alien shareholders
    Have no more than 100 shareholders
    Have only one class of stock
    Must be an eligible corporation (some financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations are not eligible).

The process for becoming a S corporation is twofold: you will need to file for S corporation designation at the federal level and then with the State of New Jersey. They are separate processes with different applications, and your business will need an S corporation designation at both levels in order to file taxes correctly and avoid any potential fees associated with an incorrect tax filing.
