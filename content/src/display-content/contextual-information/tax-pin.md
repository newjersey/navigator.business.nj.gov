## Tax PIN

The New Jersey Department of Treasury gives businesses a 4-digit tax PIN when they register for State taxes. The tax PIN is on the "Welcome Letter" you received when you first registered your business. You use your tax PIN to submit New Jersey tax payments and returns either online or by phone.

If you can't find your tax PIN, you can get help obtaining your [tax PIN](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/assets/contact/taxation/contact-pin.shtml). To submit this request you will be asked for your NJ Corporate ID Number, this is the same number as your `Entity ID|entity-id`.
