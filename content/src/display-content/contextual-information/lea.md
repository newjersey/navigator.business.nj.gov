A Local Enforcing Agency (LEA) is a state or local government entity that enforces the Uniform Fire Code. LEA conducts routine fire inspections and makes sure fire safety regulations are met. 

To find your LEA, look for your town in the [LEA directory](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf) and check the “Local Enforcing Agency Information” section.
