A Local Enforcing Agency (LEA) can be a fire department or fire prevention bureau. An LEA can also be a county fire marshal, fire district, or the state Division of Fire Safety.

LEAs enforce state and local fire safety regulations in a town. They conduct routine fire inspections and make sure fire safety regulations are met.

To find your LEA, look for your town in the [LEA directory](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf). Check the “Local Enforcing Agency Information” section for the LEA contact info.
