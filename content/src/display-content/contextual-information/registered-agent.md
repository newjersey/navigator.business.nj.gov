## Registered Agent

This is the person or company that receives legal documents on behalf of a business. A business owner can serve as their own registered agent as long as the business owner has a New Jersey address. 

Only businesses offering Registered Agent Services have a registered agent number. Business owners acting as their own registered agents are not issued a registered agent number.
