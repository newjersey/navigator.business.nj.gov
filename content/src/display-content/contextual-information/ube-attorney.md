The UBE is a standardized test drafted by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE). It's uniformly administered, graded, and scored in all participating states.  

The UBE has three parts:
- The Multistate Bar Examination (MBE)
- The Multistate Essay Examination
- The Multistate Performance Test 

Applicants who take the UBE earn a portable score that can be transferred to other UBE jurisdictions.
