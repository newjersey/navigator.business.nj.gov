Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) is discarded material that may be contaminated with body fluids or infectious materials from people or animals. In New Jersey, RMW falls under 7 categories:

* Used needles and syringes
* Unused needles and syringes
* Human tissue, body parts, body fluids, and organs
* Blood and blood products
* Animal waste that came into contact with germs or diseases during scientific research
* Trash from patients with highly contagious diseases
* Samples and materials that contain infectious germs
* Every type of RMW must be treated to kill harmful germs. Then it must be broken into small, unrecognizable pieces before it is thrown away.
