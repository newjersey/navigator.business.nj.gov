Your Department of Labor and Workforce Services (DOL) Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a 15-digit number.

&nbsp;

It starts with 0, then your 12-digit `NJ Tax ID,|tax-id` and ends with 00 (or a 2-digit code if your employee leasing company gave you one).

&nbsp;

For example, if your NJ Tax ID is 123456789000, and you do **not** have a client-level code, your DOL EIN would be: 012345678900000. 

If you **do** have an assigned 2-digit code, such as “15,” your DOL EIN would be: 012345678900015. 

&nbsp;

You may also see your DOL EIN referred to as:

* 15-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN)
* NJ-EIN, or
* NJ Labor and Workforce Development Employer Identification Number (NJLWD EIN)
