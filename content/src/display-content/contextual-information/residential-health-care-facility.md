A free-standing residential health care facility:
* Is for residents who don’t need skilled nursing care
* Provides supervised sheltered care and personal services
* Helps residents maintain personal interests and dignity
* Protects residents’ health and safety 

This type of facility operates on its own. It is not part of a hospital, medical center, or similar facility located with and operated by a licensed health care facility.
