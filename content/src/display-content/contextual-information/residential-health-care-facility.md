A free-standing residential health care facility:

* Provides supervised sheltered care and personal services in a homelike setting
* Is for residents who donâ€™t need skilled nursing care

This type of facility operates on its own. It is not part of a hospital, medical center, or similar facility located with and operated by a licensed health care facility.
