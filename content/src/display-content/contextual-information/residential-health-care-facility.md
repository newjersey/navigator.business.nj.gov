A free-standing residential health care facility:

- Is for residents who don’t need skilled nursing care
- Provides supervised sheltered care and personal services
- Helps residents maintain personal interests and dignity
- Protects residents’ health and safety

This type of facility operates on its own. It is not part of a hospital, medical center, or similar facility located with and operated by a licensed health care facility.
