Benefits are payable to workers who lose their jobs or who are working less than full-time because of a lack of full-time work and who meet the eligibility requirements. As an employer, you are required to have unemployment insurance. The unemployment insurance rate is calculated by your experience rate, and determined on an annual basis. Your rate is the same for all employees.  Visit the [Division of Unemployment Insurance](https://www.myunemployment.nj.gov/) for specific details.
