Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a program that gives financial support to employees who:

- Lost their jobs or had their full-time work hours reduced through no fault of their own
- [Meet the eligibility requirements](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myunemployment/before/about/who/index.shtml)

As an employer, you are required to have unemployment insurance.

Your UI contribution rate is determined by your experience rate. Your experience rate is based on the number of UI benefits paid to former employees.

Your UI contribution rate is redetermined every year and is the same for all employees. [Learn how Unemployment Insurance rates are calculated.](https://www.nj.gov/labor/ea/employer-services/rate-info/)

If any of your current or former employees apply for UI benefits, you will be notified.

[Visit the Division of Unemployment Insurance for more details](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myunemployment/employers/).
