The form of property ownership defines how a person or business entity legally holds or owns a piece of real estate. Your form of property ownership can affect factors such as:

- Who has control over the property
- How ownership interest is divided among multiple parties
- What happens to the property in certain scenarios, such as a sale or death of an owner

If your business owns the property as an asset, your `business structure|business-structure-learn-more` will determine how the property is legally owned.

Common forms of property ownership include:

- General Partnership
- Individual/Sole Proprietorship
- Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
- Condominium Association
- Cooperative
- Corporation
- Government Agency
- Mutual Housing Corporation
