The form of property ownership defines how a person or business entity legally holds or owns a piece of real estate. Your form of property ownership can affect factors such as:

* Who has control over the property
* How ownership interest is divided among multiple parties
* What happens to the property in certain scenarios, such as a sale or death of an owner

If your business owns the property as an asset, your `business structure|business-structure-learn-more` will determine how the property is legally owned.

* General Partnership
* Individual/Sole Proprietorship
* Limited Liability Company (LLC)
* Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
* Condominium Association
* Cooperative
* Corporation
* Government Agency
* Mutual Housing Corporation
