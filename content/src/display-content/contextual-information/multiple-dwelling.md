A multiple dwelling is a property where people live in separate units or homes. The dwelling can be a building or group of buildings on the same land. Examples of multiple dwellings include:

* An apartment building with three or more units where each unit is occupied by different people or households
* A condominium complex with buildings that have three or more units owned by different people
* A townhouse development with separate units, each occupied by different households

If you own a multile dwelling, you need to register the property with the Department of Community Affairs.
