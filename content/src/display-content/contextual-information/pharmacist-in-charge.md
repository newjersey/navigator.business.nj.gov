## Pharmacist In Charge

The pharmacist in charge assumes legal responsibility for the pharmacy and is responsible for ensuring federal and state laws are met, and are, in part, a recipient of the pharmacy permit. The pharmacist in charge must be licensed in the State of New Jersey and cannot be the pharmacist in charge of any other location. Should the pharmacist in charge change, the New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs’ Board of Pharmacy must be notified.

For a full list of their roles and responsibilities, review the State’s [pharmacy handbook](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/regulations/Chapter-39-State-Board-of-Pharmacy.pdf).
