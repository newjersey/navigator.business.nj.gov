A [Fabrication of Ride Certification](https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/forms/pdf_rides/cert_mfg_tmpl.pdf) confirms a carnival or amusement ride has been built according to specific quality and safety standards. The standards are set by the [American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM)](https://www.astm.org/).
