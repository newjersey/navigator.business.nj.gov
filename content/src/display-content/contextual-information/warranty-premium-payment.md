A premium payment is the cost of having warranty coverage for the new home built. You must pay the premium with a certified check made out to the "New Home Warranty Program." Make sure a principal owner of your home builder business signs the check.

The premium payment calculation is in Box 5 of the [Certificate of Participation (COP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZBqY3yS9y8Y3MMSHqwvTFtdlYvuxhWKK70fUqsXRSY/edit#heading=h.j9vn59xdw2hb) application. How to calculate the premium:

* If you're selling the home and transferring the property title to the buyer:\
  **Selling Price x Builder Rate = Premium**\
  Example: $500,000 x 0.00319 = $1,595\
  Put this information in Box 5A of the application.
* If the home is not under contract for sale at the time of enrollment:\
  **Fair Market Value Price x Builder Rate = Premium**\
  Example: $500,000 x 0.00319 = $1,595\
  Put this information in Box 5A of the application. The fair market value price is in the fair market value letter from the realtor. If the home sells for more than the fair market value price, you must submit a copy of the closing settlement statement after closing. You also need to submit the difference in the premium.
* If you built the home on the property owner's land for their personal use and it will not be listed for sale:\
  **Total Cost of Construction x 1.25 x Builder Rate = Premium**\
  Example: $1,000,000 x 1.25 x 0.00319 = $3,987.50\
  Put this information in Box 5B of the application.
