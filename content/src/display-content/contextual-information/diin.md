A Division Issued Identification number (DIIN) is a 9-digit number assigned to you by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. You must [apply for a DIIN](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Documents/Certification-Form-for-Applicants-with-no-Social-Security-Number-or-Individual-Taxpayer-ID-Number.pdf#search=social%20security) if you do not have a Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN).
