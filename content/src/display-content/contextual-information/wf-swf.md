The Workforce Development Partnership Fund (WF) helps pay for job training programs in New Jersey. It funds free services like the Stateâ€™s [One-Stop Career Centers](https://www.nj.gov/labor/career-services/contact-us/one-stops/).

The Supplemental Workforce Fund (SWF) pays for training in basic job skills, like team building and conflict resolution.

Both funds get money from small payroll taxes. The tax rates for WF and SWF are combined.
