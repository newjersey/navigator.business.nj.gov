If you own or operate a specific ride model or type, it's likely type-certified. Ride manufacturers are required to have a type certification before they can sell a new ride to an operator in the state. The certification ensures the ride meets safety and design standards.

If your ride is not type-certified, this usually means the manufacturer did not renew the certification or no longer supports the ride. In that case, you'll need an `individual approval|individual-approval`.
