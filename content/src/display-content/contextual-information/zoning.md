Every municipality (City, Township, Borough, etc.) has a Land Use/Zoning Ordinance which regulates the kinds of business activities that are permitted within a designated zone and places restrictions on building or land parcels, including:

- Building setbacks
- Building heights
- Signage
- Various other aspects of the land usage

Speaking with a zoning office will help you make sure you are allowed to use the space for your business. Failure to do so might result in unexpected costs associated with receiving zoning approvals.

Generally, the easiest way to get set up is to find a location that was formerly the same type of business as yours. For example, if you're opening a restaurant, you might try to find a space that used to be a restaurant. This usually means that the property already has the correct zoning and permits for your business, although you should always verify with the local Zoning Office to be sure.

When evaluating a location for your business, you should consult with your local Zoning Officer to determine the suitability of the site for your purposes and what obligations you will have, including possible Planning/Zoning or Land use board approvals. If you don't check zoning requirements/restrictions before signing a lease, it may result in unexpected expenses.
