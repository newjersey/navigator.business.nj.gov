### Surety Bond
A surety bond is a contract giving a financial guarantee to the customer that the contractor will complete agreed upon tasks and act in accordance with the terms established by the bond. The customer can make a claim to recover losses if the contractor fails to fulfill the task. If the claim is valid, the insurance company will pay reparation up to the bond amount and will expect the contract to reimburse them for the claim paid.
