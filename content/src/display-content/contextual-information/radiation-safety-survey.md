During a **radiation safety survey**, a professional inspects your site to make sure the x-ray machine is not leaking radiation outside of the machineâ€™s parameters. Visit the [Reports for Medical Physicists page](https://www.nj.gov/dep/rpp/medphys/reports_phys.html) to find a qualified individual. 

**Radiation** is a type of energy that can be harmful in large amounts. It is used in various ways, such as in x-rays and cancer treatment.
