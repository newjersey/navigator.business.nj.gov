The [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) is a federal law that helps people with disabilities get equal access. New buildings must follow special rules to make sure they are accessible. Businesses must also fix any problems that make it hard for people with disabilities to move around. The law says new buildings must follow the [2010 ADA Standards](https://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm).

If you want to make your property ADA compliant, look at your renovation plans to see if you need to make it more accessible. Talk to your landlord about ADA compliance to know who pays for costs and deals with legal issues. Having a Certified Access Specialist (CAS) check the property can help find changes needed to follow the rules.
