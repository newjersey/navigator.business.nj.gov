## The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a Federal civil rights law designed to ensure equal access, full inclusion and participation for people with disabilities or impairments. Under the law, people with disabilities are entitled to full and equal access to places of public accommodation, transportation carriers, lodging places, recreation and amusement facilities, and other business establishments where the general public is invited.

The [Federal ADA regulations](https://www.ada.gov/) require that all new construction for public accommodations comply with the [2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Standards](https://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm). In addition, the ADA says that a public accommodation has a continuing obligation to remove architectural barriers (barrier removal) to make sure your business is accessible, even when your business is not otherwise contemplating construction. This includes existing barriers at entrances, aisles, bathrooms, and service counters that may have predated the ADA and your ownership of the business.
