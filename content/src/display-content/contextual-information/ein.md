An Employer Identification Number (EIN, also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number or Federal Tax Identification Number) is a 9-digit number given to businesses and organizations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Your EIN is a unique identifier, like a Social Security number (SSN), but for your business. This number never expires.

An EIN is required for:

- Multi-member LLCs
- LPs
- LLPs
- Corporations
- General Partners
- Anyone with employees

Sole Proprietors and single-member LLCs are not required to have an EIN if they don't have employees; they can instead use their SSN. However, the New Jersey Department of Treasury strongly recommends getting an EIN. Having an EIN can improve privacy and in some cases makes it easier to do taxes.

Out-of-State Businesses can use the same EIN they registered with in their home state.
