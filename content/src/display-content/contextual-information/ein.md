header: Employer Identification Number

An Employer Identification Number (EIN, also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number or Federal Tax Identification Number) is issued by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Your EIN is a unique identifier for your businessâ€”it does not expire and once a number has been assigned to a business, it is never issued again.

**New Businesses**:
Every business regardless of legal structure can benefit from having an EIN. An EIN is required for LLCs, LP, LLP, Corporations, General Partners and anyone with employees. 

While Sole Propriters are not required to have an EIN if they don't have employees, having an EIN can make it easier to do taxes. An EIN is often required for other business purposes, such as opening a bank account or obtaining a loan. 

**Out-of-State Businesses** can use the same EIN that they registered with in their home state.
