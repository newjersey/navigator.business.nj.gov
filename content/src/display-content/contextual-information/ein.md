## Employer Identification Number

An Employer Identification Number (EIN, also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number or Federal Tax Identification Number) is issued by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). You will use your Employer Identification Number when you pay employees and file business tax returns. It is often also required for other business purposes, such as opening a bank account or obtaining a loan. Your EIN is a unique identifier for your businessâ€”it does not expire and once a number has been assigned to a business, it is never issued again.
