A Notice to Cease is a written warning you give to a tenant when they:

* Break the rules and regulations of the lease
* Break the covenants or agreements of the lease
* Show disruptive behavior and disturb other tenants or neighbors
* Do not pay rent or pay late repeatedly

The notice tells your tenant to stop the behavior that breaks the lease within a reasonable time frame that you set. If your tenant doesnâ€™t comply, then you can give them a `Notice to Quit|notice-to-quit` and move forward with the eviction process.
