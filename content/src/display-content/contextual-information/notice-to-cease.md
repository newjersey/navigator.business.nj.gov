A Notice to Cease is a written warning you must give to a tenant when they:

* Exhibit disorderly conduct and disturb other tenants or neighbors
* Break the rules and regulations on the lease
* Break the covenants or agreements on the lease
* Repeatedly do not pay rent or pay late

The notice tells your tenant to stop the behavior that breaks the lease within a reasonable time frame. If your tenant doesnâ€™t comply, then you can give them a `Notice to Quit|notice-to-quit` and proceed with the eviction process.
