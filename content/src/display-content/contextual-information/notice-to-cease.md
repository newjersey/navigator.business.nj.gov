A Notice to Cease is a written warning you give to a tenant when they:

- Break the rules and regulations of the lease
- Break the covenants or agreements of the lease
- Show disruptive behavior and disturb other tenants or neighbors
- Do not pay rent or pay late repeatedly

The notice tells your tenant to stop the behavior that violates the lease terms. If your tenant does not comply, then you can give them a `Notice to Quit|notice-to-quit` and move forward with the eviction process.
