## Conditional & Conversion License

This is a two-part application process. A conditional license allows you to build your cannabis business, but **not** operate yet. Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then apply for your conversion license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isnâ€™t fully operational. Conditional/conversion license applications have priority review over annual license applications.
