A conditional license allows you to build your cannabis business but **not** operate it. You don't need to own or lease a site or obtain municipal approval to receive this license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isn’t ready to fully operate.

Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then need to apply for a conversion license. With a conversion license you can legally run your cannabis business.

Conditional/Conversion license applications have priority review over annual license applications.
