A **conditional license** allows you to start your cannabis business but not operate it. You don't need to own or lease a site or obtain municipal approval to apply for this license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isn’t ready to fully operate.

Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then need to apply for a **conversion license**. With a conversion license, you can legally run your cannabis business.

Conditional and conversion license applications receive priority review over `annual license|cannabis-annual-license` applications within each priority category (Social Equity Business, Diversely-Owned Business, and Impact Zone Business).
