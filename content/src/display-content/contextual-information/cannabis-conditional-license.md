A conditional license allows you to build your cannabis business but **not** operate it. You don't need to own or lease a site or obtain municipal approval to receive this license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isnâ€™t ready to fully operate.

Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then need to apply for a conversion license. With a conversion license you can legally run your cannabis business.

Conditional/Conversion license applications have priority review over annual license applications.
