A **conditional license** allows you to start your cannabis business but not operate it. You don't need to own or lease a site or obtain municipal approval to apply for this license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isnâ€™t ready to fully operate.

Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then need to apply for a **conversion license**. With a conversion license, you can legally run your cannabis business.

Conditional and conversion license applications get priority review over `annual license|annual-license` applications.
