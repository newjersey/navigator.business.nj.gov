## Conditional & Conversion Licenses

A conditional license allows you to build your cannabis business, but **not** operate yet. You do not need to own or lease a site or obtain municipal approval to receive this license. This is a good approach if your business is starting to develop but isnâ€™t ready to fully operate.

Once you are ready to operate and have the necessary paperwork, you then need to apply for your conversion license. With a conversion license you can legally run your cannabis business. 

Conditional/conversion license applications have priority review over annual license applications.
