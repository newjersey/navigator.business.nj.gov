## Certificate of Good Standing

This document certifies that you are properly registered for taxes with the state and are able to operate as a business.

It does NOT indicate that you are in good standing with your taxes; that document is called a Tax Clearance Certificate. Although a Certificate of Good Standing is not required to run your business, you'll need it to apply for financial resources, or to do business in another state.

Important: A Certificate of Good Standing is only available upon request and only through the New Jersey Division of Revenue. If you received a notice in the mail and did not request a Certificate of Good Standing, confirm that it was sent by the Division of Revenue.
