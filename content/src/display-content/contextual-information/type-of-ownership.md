Type of ownership refers to how a business is owned. It affects your business operations, taxes, and personal liability.

There are different types of ownership for different business structures. For example:

* **Sole proprietorship:** Owned by one person who is personally responsible for the business, including debts and taxes
* **Partnership:** Owned by 2 or more people who share the responsibilities
* **Corporation:** Owned by shareholders and is a separate legal entity from its owners
* **Cooperative (co-op):** Owned and run by its members, who make decisions together for their shared benefit
