If you're planning to do any construction, alteration, or repair work, you may need a building permit. Building permits are issued by your local government's Building/Construction Department and help ensure any work done in your area conforms with building code and zoning requirements that protect everyone's safety.

Building permits are generally required for building, structural, electric, HVAC, and plumbing projects such as:

- New buildings or structures
- Additions to a building
- Structural alterations to a building or structure
- Interior modifications and changes to a floor plan
- Changes in building use and/or occupancy
- Parking layout changes
- Use-of-land projects, such as recycling deposit center, open-air storage, outdoor temporary events
- Signs and sign structures
- Fences, retaining walls, and shoring plans

Occasionally, repairs may need a blueprint sealed by a licensed architect. This requirement can be confirmed with your local government's Building/Construction Permit Office.
