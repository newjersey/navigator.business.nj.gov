## Construction Permits

If you're planning to do any construction, alteration, or repair work, you'll probably need to get a building permit. Building permits are issued by your local government's Building/Construction Department and help to ensure that any work done in your area conforms with building code and zoning requirements that protect the safety of you, your team, and your customers.

Building permits are generally required for any building, structural, electric, HVAC, and plumbing projects. In some instances these repairs may need a blueprint sealed by a licensed architect. They can include projects such as:

- New buildings or structures
- Additions to a building
- Structural alterations to a building or structure
- Interior modifications and changes to a floor plan
- Changes of building use and/or occupancy
- Parking layout changes
- Use-of-land projects, such as recycling deposit center, open air storage, outdoor temporary events
- Signs and sign structures
- Fences, retaining walls and shoring plans
