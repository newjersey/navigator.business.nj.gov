A Notice of Violation is a letter that tells you if your property or business broke certain codes, laws, or regulations. This notice gets mailed to the property or business owner after an inspection, investigation, or complaint. Some state agencies let you view and download this notice online.
You should review your Notice of Violation because it has information about:

- The code or law you broke
- What you need to fix and when to fix it by
- If you need to apply for a construction permit to fix the violation
- Additional penalties, if you don't fix it by the given due date
- How to appeal the violation if you don't agree with it
- Who to contact if you're not sure what to do next
