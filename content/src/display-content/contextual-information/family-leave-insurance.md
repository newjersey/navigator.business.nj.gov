New Jersey Family Leave Insurance (FLI) provides partial wage replacement to employees who need time off to bond with a child or care for a family member. Employers don't pay into the program. Employees fund the program through payroll deductions.

FLI allows leave for the care of a newly born or adopted child, as long as the leave starts within a year of the child's birth or placement with the employee.

FLI also allows leave for the care of the following family members if they have a serious health condition requiring in-patient care, continuing medical treatment, require medical supervision, or are coping with domestic or sexual violence:

- A parent or parent-in-law
- A child or grandchild
- A sibling
- A grandparent
- A spouse or civil union partner
- Any other person related by blood to the employee
- Any other person with whom the employee has a close association that is the equivalent of a family relationship, including chosen family

Employees can receive up to 12 weeks of FLI if taken consecutively, or 56 days of FLI if taken intermittently.
