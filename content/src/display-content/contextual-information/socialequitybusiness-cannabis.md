### Social Equity Business or a Legacy Cannabis Application

A Social Equity Business (SEB) must have more than 50% of its ownership meet one of two criteria: 
- Have lived in an [Economically Disadvantaged Area](https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/businesses/priority-applications/eda.shtml) for 5 of the last 10 years AND have a household income 80% or less than the average median household income in New Jersey, OR
- Have been convicted of at least two disorderly persons offenses or at least one indictable offense related to marijuana or hashish

Possession with intent to distribute less than 1 ounce of marijuana was an indictable offense related to marijuana or hashish, and a person would be eligible to participate in the ownership of a Social Equity Business based on that conviction.
