Both an **Alternate Name Certificate** and a **Trade Name Certificate** confirm that a business can legally operate under a different name. This is called a trade name or a DBA (doing business as) name.

The following businesses can register an alternate name with the [Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services](https://www.njportal.com/DOR/businessrecords/EntityDocs/BusinessStatCopies.aspx):

- Corporation
- Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- Limited Partnership (LP)

The following businesses can register a trade name with the county where the business operates:

- Sole Proprietorship (SP)
- General Partnership (GP)
