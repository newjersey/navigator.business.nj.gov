An **Alternate Name Certificate** verifies a business can legally operate under a name different from its business name. The following business entities can register an alternate name with the [Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services](https://www.njportal.com/DOR/businessrecords/EntityDocs/BusinessStatCopies.aspx):

* Corporation
* Limited Liability Company (LLC)
* Limited Partnership (LP)
* Nonprofit organization 

A **Trade Name Certificate** confirms a Sole Proprietorship (SP) or General Partnership (GP) business can legally operate under a name different from its business name. Trade names are registered with the county where the business operates.
