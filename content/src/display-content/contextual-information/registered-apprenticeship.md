A Registered Apprenticeship Program is a training program approved by the [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/explore-apprenticeship). Employers can find new skilled workers and help employees learn new skills. Apprentices get paid to learn a job through hands-on experience and classroom work.\
\
These programs make it easier to fill jobs, keep employees longer, and grow your business.
