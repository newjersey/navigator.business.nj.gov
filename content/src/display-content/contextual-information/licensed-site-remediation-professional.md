A Licensed Site Remediation Professional (LSRP) is an expert who is trained to manage and clean up contaminated sites. They make sure sites are safe for people and the environment.

A [list of LSRPs](https://njems.nj.gov/DataMiner/Search/SearchByCategory?isExternal=y&getCategory=y&catName=Site+Remediation) is available at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's DataMiner website. Scroll to “Licensed Site Remediation Professional List.”

**Note:** the DEP cannot recommend an LSRP.
