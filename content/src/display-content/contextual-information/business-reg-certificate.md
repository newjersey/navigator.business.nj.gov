### Business Registration Certificate

A Business Registration Certificate (BRC) is a document issued after completing your business registration with the State of New Jersey. If you completed the business registration online, you will be issued a printable version of the BRC immediately. You will also receive a copy of the BRC in the mail a few weeks later.

The BRC contains a control number that is used to verify that your business registration is current. You must display the BRC prominently in your place of business.
