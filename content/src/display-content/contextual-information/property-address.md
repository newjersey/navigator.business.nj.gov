In real estate, a property refers to the land you own and any buildings or other structures on it, such as a parking lot.

When applying for licenses or permits for your property, you need to provide your property address. You can find this address on your deed or property tax bill.

Some applications will ask you for a building address. In most cases, this is the same as your property address. If you have several buildings on the property, they may each have a building number assigned to them.
