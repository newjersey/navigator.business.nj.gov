You have a home-based business if you:

- Operate from home
- Do not have a brick and mortar (physical) location anywhere else, like a shop or office

Not all businesses can be home-based, so check with your local government zoning office.

If you select “home-based business” on the site, you will see permits or licenses you may need to open or run your business in your Business.NJ.gov account. Selecting this option will not change your list of funding opportunities.
