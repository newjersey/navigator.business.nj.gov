A Notice to Quit is a written notice to end a tenancy. You must give this notice to your tenant before you can file an eviction suit. The notice is required for all [legal reasons for an eviction](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_lti/grnds_for_evicti_bulltin.pdf), except not paying rent. 

The notice lets your tenant know they need to move out by a certain date. It should also have specific details about why they are being evicted. 

In some cases, you may need a `Notice to Cease|notice-to-cease` before you can give a Notice to Quit.
