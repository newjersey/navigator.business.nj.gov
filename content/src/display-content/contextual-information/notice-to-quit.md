A Notice to Quit is a written notice to end a tenancy. You must give this notice to your tenant before you can file an eviction suit. The notice is required for all [legal grounds for an eviction](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_lti/grnds_for_evicti_bulltin.pdf), except not paying rent.Â 

The notice should include specific details about why you are ending the tenancy.

In some cases, a `Notice to Cease|notice-to-cease` is required before you can give a Notice to Quit.
