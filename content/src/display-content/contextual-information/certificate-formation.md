A **Certificate of Formation** confirms the formation of your business as a Corporation, LLC, LP, or LLP, and gives it a unique 10-digit Entity ID number to keep track of your corporate (non-tax) records.

A **Certificate of Incorporation** is the same as a Certificate of Formation. Out-of-state businesses will sometimes have a Certificate of Incorporation because that's the term used in that state.


A **Certificate of Authority** gives permission to an out-of-state or foreign business to operate in the State of New Jersey.
