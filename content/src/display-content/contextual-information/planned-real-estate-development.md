A Planned Real Estate Development (PRED) refers to land developed for common-interest communities.

In these communities, people own their own unit or lot, but share ownership of common areas, such as a pool or tennis court.

Examples include:

- Condominiums
- Homeowner associations (HOA)
- Cooperative (Co-Op) housing
- Retirement communities.
