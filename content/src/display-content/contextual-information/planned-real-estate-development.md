In a common-interest community (or planned real estate development), residents own their own unit or lot and share ownership of certain spaces, such as a park or pool. These communities are managed by a homeowners' or condominium association.

Examples of common-interest communities:
* Condominiums
* Cooperative housing
* Retirement communities
* Subdivisions with a homeowners' association
