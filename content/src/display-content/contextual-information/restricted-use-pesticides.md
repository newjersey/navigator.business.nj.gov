Restricted use pesticides are more dangerous to humans, animals, and earth than regular pesticides. As a result, only people with a specific training and certification can sell and apply them. 

To find out which pesticides are restricted, see section “7:30-2.10 Restricted use pesticide” in the [Pesticides Control Code](https://dep.nj.gov/wp-content/uploads/rules/rules/njac7_30.pdf) document.
