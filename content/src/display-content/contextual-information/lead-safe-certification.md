If your home or rental property was built before 1978, it must be inspected for interior lead-based paint hazards. You don't need an inspection if your property is [exempt](https://nj.gov/dca/codes/resources/leadpaint.shtml).

Work with a [certified lead abatement contractor](https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/offices/leadhazard_abatement.shtml)to fix any hazards found. After remediation and following inspections, you will get one of three certificates:

* **Lead-safe**: Confirms your property does not have interior lead-based paint hazards. This certificate is valid for two years. The property must be re-inspected after
* **Lead-free**: Confirms your property is free of lead paint. This certificate is valid for life and exempts your property from future lead inspections
* **Lead-hazard free**: Confirms no conditions in your property can cause lead exposure. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance may be needed, depending on your town
