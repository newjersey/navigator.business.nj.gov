Homes and rental units built before 1978 must be inspected for lead paint hazards, with some [exemptions](https://nj.gov/dca/codes/resources/leadpaint.shtml).

Based on the inspection results, you will get one of these three certificates:

* **Lead-safe**: Confirms your property does not have interior lead-based paint hazards. This certificate is valid for two years.
* **Lead-free**: Confirms your property is completely free of lead paint. This certificate is valid for life and exempts your property from future lead inspections.
* **Lead-hazard free**: Confirms there are no conditions in your property that can cause lead exposure. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance may be needed, depending on your town.
