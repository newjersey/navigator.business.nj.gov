Your NJ Tax ID number will be a 12-digit number: the first 9-digits are often the same as your EIN (Federal Employer Identification Number or Federal Tax Identification Number) and the last 3-digits are a location code provided by the State. Your first location code is 000. **_This number is sensitive information and is used for state tax purposes._**

If you completed the NJ-Reg form online, you will find your NJ Tax ID number on the registration confirmation after registering for state taxes and employer purposes.

:::infoAlert

The New Jersey Treasury Department has updated its terminology. You may find "NJ Taxpayer ID" instead of Filer ID in your documentation.
