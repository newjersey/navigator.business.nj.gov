### New Jersey Tax ID

Your NJ Tax ID number will be the same as your EIN number plus a 3-digit location code and is used for state tax purposes only. 

If you completed the NJ-Reg form online, you will find your NJ Tax ID number on the registration confirmation after completing your business registration.
