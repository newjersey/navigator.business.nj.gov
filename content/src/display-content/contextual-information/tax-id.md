Your NJ Tax ID number will be a 12-digit number: the first 9-digits are often the same as your EIN (Federal Employer Identification Number or Federal Tax Identification Number) and the last 3-digits are a location code provided by the State. Your first location code is 000. **_This number is sensitive information and is used for state tax purposes._**

If you completed the NJ-Reg form online, you will find your NJ Tax ID number on the registration confirmation after registering for state taxes and employer purposes.

The New Jersey Treasury Department has updated its terminology. You may find "NJ Taxpayer ID" instead of Filer ID in your documentation.
