Domestic workers provide in-home services to private households, including child care, house cleaning, care for elderly or disabled people, and cooking.

These are examples of domestic workers:

* nannies
* child care providers
* au pairs
* babysitters
* caretakers or companions for elderly, disabled or convalescing individuals
* house cleaners, cooks, and gardeners

Domestic workers can be hired directly by a household or by an agency. Some work for multiple clients. They can be full-time, part-time, or temporary workers. They can be paid a salary or hourly, and by cash, check, or direct deposit.

Even if an employer is not registered with the State, and pays cash "off the books," a domestic worker is entitled to their rights, including a written contract and other protections.

Some domestic workers live in their employer's home. Live-in workers have additional rights and protections.
