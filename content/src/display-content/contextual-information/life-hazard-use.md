Life Hazard Use (LHU) is a label given to businesses with a commercial or manufacturing space that poses a high risk to human life in a fire or other emergency. [Contact your Local Enforcing Agency (LEA)](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf) to learn if your business is an LHU.

LHU businesses:

- Need to [register with the state Division of Fire Safety](https://firesolutions.dca.nj.gov/) to operate
- Get inspected by a state inspector on a schedule based on the type of business and how the space is used
