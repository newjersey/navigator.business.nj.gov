A public offering statement is a legal document developers must give to prospective buyers. This document lets buyers know what to expect when they buy a property in a planned real estate development.

The public offering statement includes information such as:

* Bylaws of the condominium or homeownersâ€™ association
* Any existing or planned shared areas and amenities
* Estimated title closing or settlement costs the buyer needs to pay

Real estate or land use attorneys draft this document on behalf of developers.
