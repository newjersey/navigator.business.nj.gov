- Gross revenue from sales delivered into New Jersey during the current or prior calendar year, exceeds $100,000 or
- Sold products or services delivered into New jersey in 200 or more separate transactions during the current or prior calendar year

If your business meets any of the criteria above, you are a remote seller and will need to register for State taxes.
