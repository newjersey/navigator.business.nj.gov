## Lease Considerations

There are no standard rules for the length of a commercial lease â€“ they can range anywhere from month-to-month to ten years and beyond. What's right for your business will depend on many factors, but you should consider how much rent can increase each year, what happens if your landlord decides to sell the property, or a neighboring anchor tenant leaves. If you need to close or move your business consider your options to sublet the space, transfer the lease to a new business owner, or terminate the lease.
