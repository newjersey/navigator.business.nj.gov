An Individual Approval confirms a specific ride you own — not a ride model or type — meets safety and design standards.

Your ride needs an Individual Approval if it doesn't have a `Type Certification|type-certification`. The approval lets you buy, set up, and run a ride without a Type Certification or the ride manufacturer's continued support.
