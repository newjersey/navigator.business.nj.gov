An individual approval confirms a specific ride you own — not a ride model or type — meets safety and design standards.

Your ride needs an individual approval if it doesn't have a `type certification|type-certification`. The approval lets you buy, set up, and run a ride without a type certification or the ride manufacturer's continued support.
