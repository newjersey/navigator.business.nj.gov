An elevator device is an elevator, escalator, moving walk, dumbwaiter, wheelchair lift, chair lift, or man lift.

If you own a space, such as a commercial, manufacturing, or rental space, with an elevator device, you must register the device with the Department of Community Affairs before you can use it or do any work to it.
