An [A-901](https://dep.nj.gov/wastedecals/commercial-solid-waste-transporters/), or [Self-Generator](https://dep.nj.gov/wastedecals/self-generator-solid-waste-transporters/) cab card, is a paper certificate. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issues it for every approved vehicle. You must keep it in the vehicle. This proves you can legally transport solid or medical waste in New Jersey.
