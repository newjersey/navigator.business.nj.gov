Non-Life Hazard Use is a label assigned to businesses that do not present a high risk to human life during fires and other emergencies. [Find your Local Enforcing Agency (LEA)](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf) to learn if your business is an NLHU and needs to be registered with your LEA.

If you need to register your business as an NLHU, your business will be added to the schedule for routine fire inspections after registration. When and how often inspections occur depends on your town, so check with your LEA so you can prepare accordingly.

NLHU businesses may also need to renew registration and pay any associated fees.
