Non-Life Hazard Use (NLHU) is a label given to businesses with a commercial or manufacturing space that does not pose a high risk to human life in a fire or other emergency. [Contact your Local Enforcing Agency (LEA)](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf) to see if your business is an NLHU.

NLHU businesses:

* May need to register with their LEA each year to operate
* Get inspected by a state or local inspector on a schedule based on the type of business and how the space is used
