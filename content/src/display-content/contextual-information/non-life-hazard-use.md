Non-Life Hazard Use is a label assigned to businesses that do not present a high risk to human life during fires and other emergencies. [Find your Local Enforcing Agency (LEA)](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/pdf/fire_code_enforcement_director.pdf) to learn if your business is an NLHU.Â 

If your business is an NLHU, you must register with your LEA and pay the associated fee to operate your business. After registration, your business will be added to the schedule for routine fire inspections. When and how often these occur depends on your town, so check with your LEA so you can prepare accordingly.

NLHU businesses must also renew registration and pay the associated fee annually.
