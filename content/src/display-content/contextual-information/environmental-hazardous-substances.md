Environmental Hazardous Substances (EHS) are specific chemicals that can be dangerous to the environment (water, air, and soil). If these chemicals are not handled correctly, they can cause pollution and harm people, plants, or animals. An [updated list of EHS](<link: https://www.nj.gov/dep/enforcement/opppc/crtk/ehsalpha.pdf>) is available at the Community Right to Know (CRTK) website. This list also includes CRTK reporting thresholds.
