An **economically disadvantaged individual** is a person whose ability to compete in business has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities compared to others in the same or similar line of business. The owners’ personal net worth generally may not exceed $1.32 million. This does not include equity in the owners’ personal residence or business for which the person is applying for certification.
