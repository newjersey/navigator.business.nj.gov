For certification purposes, the New Jersey Department of Transportation defines a socially disadvantaged individual as an individual who self-identifies as:

- A woman
- Black/African American
- Hispanic/Latino
- Native American
- Native Alaskan
- Asian
- Pacific Islander
- Native Hawaiian

Individuals who do not identify as any of the above may provide evidence of social disadvantage. These applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and must include all the following elements:

- At least one, objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage
- Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social disadvantage in American society
- Negative impacts on entry into or advancement in business

An **economically disadvantaged individual** is a person whose ability to compete in business has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities compared to others in the same or similar line of business. The owners’ personal net worth generally may not exceed $1.32 million. This does not include equity in the owners’ personal residence or business for which the person is applying for certification.
