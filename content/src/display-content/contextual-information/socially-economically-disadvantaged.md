**A socially disadvantaged individual** is a person subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias. Some persons are presumed to be socially disadvantaged. 

For certification purposes, those persons are women and members of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Native Alaskan, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Native Hawaiian.

Other persons who are not members of these groups may provide evidence of social disadvantage. These applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and must include all the following elements:

* At least one, objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage.
* Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social disadvantage in American society.
* Negative impacts on entry into or advancement in business.

An **economically disadvantaged individual** is a person whose ability to compete in business has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities compared to others in the same or similar line of business. The owners’ personal net worth generally may not exceed $1.32 million. This does not include equity in the owners’ personal residence or business for which the person is applying for certification.
