Depending on the specific site and your renovation plans, you may need to make accessibility upgrades from widening aisles to changing bathroom fixtures.

Ask your landlord if the space is `ADA|ada` compliant and discuss who will be responsible for any costs associated with accessibility upgrades and/or litigation should a lawsuit be filed. You can have a Certified Access Specialist (CAS) inspect the property and identify any needed changes to make the property ADA compliant.
