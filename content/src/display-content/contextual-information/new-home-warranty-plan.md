A New Home Warranty Plan is a 10-year warranty coverage for major construction problems in the houses you build. As a new home builder, you must enroll each house you build in a State or [approved private warranty plan](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/offices/nhw_war_plans.html). The houses you build cannot be legally occupied until you enroll them in a warranty plan.
