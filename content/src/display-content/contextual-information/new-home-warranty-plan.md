A New Home Warranty is a limited 10-year warranty coverage on the new home you build. The warranty covers problems with the materials, how the work was done, the systems (such as plumbing or electrical), or the structure of the home.

New home builders need to enroll each home they build in the State warranty plan or [approved private warranty plan](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/offices/nhw_war_plans.html). The homes can’t be legally occupied without a warranty plan.
