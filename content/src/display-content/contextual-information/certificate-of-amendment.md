A Certificate of Amendment is a form you can file with the New Jersey Division of Revenue & Enterprise Services (DORES). Use this document if something changed since you formed your business. It is different from a

 `certificate-of-correction|` 

.

&nbsp;

#### How is an Amendment different from a Correction?

**Amendment:** update information if something changed later (for example, a new address, new owner, or name change)

**Correction:** fix an error or typo made when you first completed the business registration paperwork

If youâ€™re unsure about which is right for you, ask an attorney or DORES.

#### What are some examples of Amendments?

File a Certificate of Amendment if:

* Your business moved to a new location
