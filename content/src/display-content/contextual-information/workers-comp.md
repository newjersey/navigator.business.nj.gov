## Workers' Compensation Insurance

Workers' compensation provides medical treatment, wage replacement, and permanent disability compensation to employees who suffer job-related injuries or illnesses, and death benefits to dependents of workers who have died as a result of their employment. The State requires this insurance if you have any full time employees. This insurance is not required for owners of an LLC, but is required for stockholders in a corporation.
