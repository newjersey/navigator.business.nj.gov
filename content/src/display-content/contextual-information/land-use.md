Land use is how you manage a site and what you can do there. A site is the area of land or property where you want to build or make changes. You might need land use permits if your project affects protected environmental locations like coastal zones, wetlands, or flood-prone areas.

Before you start a project on a site, contact the [New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP](https://dep.nj.gov/wlm/lrp/)) to learn if you need a land use permit.
