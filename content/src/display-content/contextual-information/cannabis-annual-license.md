You should be ready to operate if you want to obtain an annual cannabis license. You will be required to submit a more detailed application that includes:

* Information on your owned or leased business location
* Local government approvals, including zoning approval
* Any final agreements for your business, such as lease agreements or vendor contracts, if applicable

`Conditional license|cannabis-conditional-license` applicants will eventually need to submit this information when they're ready to convert to an annual license (also known as a conversion license).
