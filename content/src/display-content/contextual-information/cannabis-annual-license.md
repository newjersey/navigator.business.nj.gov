## Annual License

Annual licenses applicants should be ready to operate. As a result, they are required to submit a more detailed application that includes details for the proposed site for the business, which must be owned or leased, municipal approval, zoning approval, and applicants must also submit an operating summary plan in which applicants detail their experience, history, and knowledge of critical pieces of operating a cannabis business. Conditional license applicants will eventually need to submit this information too, they just submit this in a two-step process.
