A business seeking an annual Cannabis license should be ready to operate. An annual applicant will be required to submit a more detailed application that includes:

- Information on their owned or leased business location
- Municipal approval including zoning approval
- An operating summary plan in which applicants detail their experience, history, and knowledge of critical pieces of operating a cannabis business

Conditional license applicants will eventually need to submit this information when they're ready to convert to an annual license.
