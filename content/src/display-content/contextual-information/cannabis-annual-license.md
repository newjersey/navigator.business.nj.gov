## Annual License

A business seeking an annual Cannabis license should be ready to operate. An annual applicant will be required to submit a more detailed application that includes:

1. Information on their owned or leased business location
2. Municipal approval including zoning approval
3. An operating summary plan in which applicants detail their experience, history, and knowledge of critical pieces of operating a cannabis business

Conditional license applicants will eventually need to submit this information too, they just submit this in a two-step process.
