A business seeking an annual Cannabis license should be ready to operate. An annual applicant will be required to submit a more detailed application that includes:

* Information on their owned or leased business location
* Municipal approval including zoning approval
* Any final agreements for your business, such as lease agreements or vendor contracts, if applicable

Conditional license applicants will eventually need to submit this information when they're ready to convert to an annual license.
