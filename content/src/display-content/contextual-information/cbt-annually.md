There is a schedule in the CBT instruction book that provides detailed due dates:

- If the due date falls on a weekend or a legal holiday, the return and payment are due on the following business day
- The accounting year (calendar or fiscal) should be the same accounting period the business reports to the United States Treasury Department for federal income tax purposes. All accounting periods must end on the last day of the month.

While the end month of the accounting period for federal and New Jersey returns must match, the tax return year for the federal and State returns may be different and it will depend on when you are required to report the accounting period. For example, a tax year ending 8/31/20 may be filed on a 2019 federal 1120-S and a 2020 New Jersey CBT-100S.
