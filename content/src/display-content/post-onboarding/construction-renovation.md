### Site Considerations

- []{construction-renovation-site-drawings} **Site drawings:** Hire an architect to create site drawings that meet your business needs and budget
- []{construction-renovation-utilities} **Utilities:** Work with your local government on any utility or water approvals you may need
- []{construction-renovation-permits} **Construction permits:** [File for a construction permit](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/resources/constructionpermitforms.html) with your local government's building/construction department. Before filing, ask the construction department if any prior approvals are required for your industry
- []{construction-renovation-contractors} **Contractors:** Hire any contractors you may need, such as plumbers, electricians, and fire prevention, HVAC or general contractors. Industry best practice is to get 3 quotes before deciding on a contractor
