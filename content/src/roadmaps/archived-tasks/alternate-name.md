Now that you formed your business, you may decide to get an alternate business name(s).

Businesses choose to get an alternate name if they want to have different business names under the same legal structure. If you decide to have an alternate name, it must be registered with the New Jersey Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services. The application you will file is often referred to as form C-150G.

To complete this application, you must have:

- `Entity ID|entity-id`
- Desired alternate name

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A registered alternate name
