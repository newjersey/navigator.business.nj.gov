summaryDescriptionMd: >-
  All dental offices in New Jersey must register for the State’s Dental Amalgam
  Program (dental amalgam certification). This applies even if you do not use
  amalgam.
  If your dental office does not place or remove amalgam fillings, you may qualify for an exemption. But you must still register with NJDEP to establish the exemption status. Once your exemption is approved, you won’t have to renew your certifications yearly. This is true as long as your practice remains exempt.

:::infoAlert

**Keep in mind:**
If your dental office begins placing or removing amalgam fillings, your exemption no longer applies. You must install an approved `amalgam separator|amalgam-separator` and [register for a new dental amalgam certification](https://dep.nj.gov/wp-content/uploads/dwq/2023_portal_version_dental_new_user_quick_guide.pdf) with NJDEP. This ensures your office stays compliant with state environmental rules.
