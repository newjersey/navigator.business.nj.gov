If you operate a cannabis business with a conditional license that expires after 120 days, you must complete a [Conditional to Annual Conversion Application](https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/documents/businesses/recreational/Instructions%20for%20Conversion%20to%20Annual%20License%20Application.pdf). This application will get you an annual cannabis license that allows you to continue running your business. It may take about 90 days for your application to be reviewed and approved.
