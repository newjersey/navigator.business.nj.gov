You and/or your staff will need to have individual cosmetology licenses. If the business owner does not have a cosmetology license, the shop manager must have a license and at least two years of experience.

Licenses are required for cosmetologists, hairstylists, manicurists, skincare specialists, barbers, hair braiders, and beauticians. It is the shop owner's responsibility to ensure their staff is licensed.
