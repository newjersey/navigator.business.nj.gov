summaryDescriptionMd: >
  Any staff providing cosmetology services will need a cosmetology license. If the business owner of a cosmetology shop does not have a cosmetology license, the shop manager must have a license and at least two years of experience. 
  Licenses are required for cosmetologists, hairstylists, manicurists, skincare specialists, barbers, hair braiders, and beauticians. It is the shop owner's responsibility to ensure their staff is licensed.
