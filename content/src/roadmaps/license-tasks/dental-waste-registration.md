:::infoAlert
 **Keep in mind:**
If your office discharges wastewater to a septic system, contact the [Bureau of Groundwater, Residuals, and Permit Administration](https://dep.nj.gov/dwq/contact-us/#bgwrpa). They will help you find out if you are a `Significant Indirect User (SIU)|significant-indirect-user` and if you need a SIU permit. ::: If your dental office handles `amalgam waste|amalgam-waste` by placing or removing amalgam fillings, you must register for dental waste management. This allows you to get a dental amalgam certification. You must renew it every year."
