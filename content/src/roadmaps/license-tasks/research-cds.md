  :::callout{ showHeader="false" headerText="" showIcon="false" calloutType="informational" }


  If you are applying for Schedule I CDS as a researcher, you must get your [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html) registration before applying for CDS registration. In this case, you can skip to step 3.


  :::



  1. Email the NJ Drug Control Unit (DCU) at [cds@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) to request the Researcher/Facility CDS Registration application.

  2. After your completed application has been emailed to the DCU, they will email you an invoice to pay your fees online.

  3. Be sure to register with the DEA to validate your CDS registration. You will need your CDS number for this process. Email a copy of your DEA registration to [cds@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) within 60 days of completing your CDS registration.
