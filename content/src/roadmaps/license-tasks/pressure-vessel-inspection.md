## Pressure Vessels That Need Inspection

All pressure vessels must be registered and inspected after they are installed, unless they:

* Have a “UM” stamp (used for small pressure vessels), or
* Are owned by a registered owner-user inspection agency (a business that is approved to do its own inspections based on the [National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors Inspection Code](https://www.nationalboard.org/index.aspx?pageID=4#))

Most pressure vessels must be inspected every 3 years after the initial inspection. This includes:

* Unfired pressure vessels, unless they meet specific requirements
* Pressure vessels used in refrigeration systems

## Pressure Vessels That Do Not Need Inspection

If the pressure vessel **meets any** of the following conditions, it does not need to be inspected again:

* Marked with a “UM” stamp
* Internal diameter is less than 6 inches
* Operates under 15 psig (internal or external pressure)
* Can handle up to 300 psi of pressure and temperatures up to 210 degrees Fahrenheit, and holds water with air under pressure (where the air only acts as a cushion)
* Is used as a hot water tank heated by steam/indirectly and serves a building with fewer less than 6 housing units or 25 people, and does not exceed 120 gallons of capacity, 200,000 BTU of heat input, or 200 degrees Fahrenheit
* Is under the control of the United States government and is regulated by a federal agency
* Is used only for motor vehicle propulsion and is regulated by the  Motor Vehicle Act, Title 39 of the Revised Statutes \[ADD LINK]
