Landlords or other businesses that rent out one or two-family homes need to get an inspection and certificate that verifies smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers are working properly whenever a new tenant moves in. Contact your Local Enforcing Agency (LEA) to apply for the certificate and schedule an inspection.
