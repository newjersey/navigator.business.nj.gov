The certificate from the business's home state cannot be dated more than 30 days before the date you plan to submit your formation application.

When you authorize your business, make sure your business name and designator match exactly what is on your Certificate of Good Standing. Even small differences can cause issues.

If you don't get this certificate, your application may be rejected, and your filing fees may not be refunded.
