The New Jersey State Board of Accountancy requires that every new public accounting firm is registered with them. 

To register your firm you will need:

* A designated Resident Manager-In-Charge of the practice unit (a certified public accountant)
* Payment in the form of two separate checks (one for the application fee and one for the license fee)

You can download the registration form from the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs but will have to mail a paper copy to:

Division of Consumer Affairs 

New Jersey State Board of Accountancy

124 Halsey Street, 6th Floor, P.O. Box 45000 

Newark, New Jersey 07101



After you complete this task, you will have:

* A certificate indicating your firm has been registered with the New Jersey State Board of Accountancy
