  lease (or letter of intent to lease) thoroughly to confirm that you're in

## Contract Considerations

- **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation- backed (FDIC) mortgage:** Cannabis is not legal at a federal level. For this reason, properties with federally insured mortgages cannot be used for cannabis businesses
- **Lease start date:** Identify a start date for your lease that considers potential delays due to renovations, industry licenses, or other activities that are out of your control like getting local government approvals
- **Lease length:** Determine your ideal lease length by analyzing a few `lease considerations|lease-considerations`
- **Tenant improvements:** Identify the entity responsible and write out expectations for `tenant improvements|tenant-improvements` in your lease
- **Undesirable agreements:** Beware of any language that requires you to surrender any of your business ownership or equity to a landlord as a condition of leasing your space
