  Your nonprofit bylaws define how your business will operate. There's no set
  rule for how to draft bylaws, but they typically include business structure,
  `board of trustee|board-trustees` roles and responsibilities, and day-to-day
  operations, among other things.


  Check out [resources for writing nonprofit bylaws](https://business.nj.gov/pages/business-support#section-4).
