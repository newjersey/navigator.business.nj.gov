  Your nonprofit bylaws define how your business will operate. There's no set rule for how to draft bylaws,
  but they typically include business structure, `board of trustee|board-trustees` roles and responsibilities,
  and day-to-day operations, among other things.


  Check out
  [resources for writing nonprofit bylaws](https://business.nj.gov/pages/business-support#section-4).

You don't need to file your bylaws in New Jersey, but youâ€™ll need to include a copy of your bylaws when applying for nonprofit tax exempt status with the IRS. You may also be asked for a copy of your bylaws when opening a bank account to validate your business.
