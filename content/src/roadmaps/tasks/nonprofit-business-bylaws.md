  Your nonprofit bylaws define how your business will operate. There's no set
  rule for how to draft bylaws, but they typically include business structure,
  delete after this - this is test text `board of trustee|board-trustees` roles
  and responsibilities, and day-to-day operations, among other things.


  You don't need to file your bylaws in New Jersey. A copy of your bylaws are required when applying for nonprofit tax exempt status with the IRS. A copy of your bylaws may be required when opening a bank account to verify your business.

Some steps to get started include:

* **State the basics:** Start with the name of your business, its main address, and its purpose. In a sentence or two, explain what your business does.
* **Define your leadership and decision-making:** Lay out who is in charge by listing the roles of your directors and officers. Describe their responsibilities, such as managing finances or organizing meetings. Then, explain how decisions will be made, including voting rules and how many people must be present to make decisions official.
* **Organize meetings and finances:** Decide how often everyone will meet and how those meetings will run. If you have shareholders, explain when and how they’ll meet, too. For finances, set your fiscal year and outline who will handle money and keep records.
* **Plan for changes and conflicts:** Your bylaws should include steps for making updates, like voting to change the rules. Also, add a process for resolving disagreements and preventing conflicts of interest, so everyone stays focused on the business.

Have your leadership team review and sign the bylaws to make them official. It’s okay to keep things simple at first and have your bylaws grow with your business.
