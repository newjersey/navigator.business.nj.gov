## Pressure Vessels That Need Inspection

All pressure vessels must be registered and inspected after they are installed, unless they:

* Have a “UM” stamp (used for small pressure vessels), or
* Are owned by a registered owner-user inspection agency (a business that is approved to do its own inspections based on the [National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors Inspection Code](https://www.nationalboard.org/index.aspx?pageID=4#))

Most pressure vessels must be inspected every 3 years after the initial inspection. This includes:

* Unfired pressure vessels, unless they meet specific requirements
* Pressure vessels used in refrigeration systems

## Pressure Vessels That Do Not Need Inspection

If the pressure vessel **meets any** of the following conditions, it does not need to be inspected again:

* Marked with a “UM” stamp
* Internal diameter is less than 6 inches
* Operates under 15 psig (internal or external pressure)
* Can handle up to 300 psi of pressure and temperatures up to 210 degrees Fahrenheit, and holds water with air under pressure (where the air only acts as a cushion)
* Is used as a hot water tank heated by steam/indirectly and serves a building with fewer less than 6 housing units or 25 people, and does not exceed 120 gallons of capacity, 200,000 BTU of heat input, or 200 degrees Fahrenheit
* Is under the control of the United States government and is regulated by a federal agency
* Is used only for motor vehicle propulsion and is regulated by the  Motor Vehicle Act, Title 39 of the Revised Statutes \[ADD LINK]

## How Inspections Work

After your pressure vessel is registered and passes the first inspection, a State inspector or your insurance company will contact you to set up future inspections. 

Even though they keep track of the due dates, it’s your responsibility to make sure all required equipment gets inspected.
