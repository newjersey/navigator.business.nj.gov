  Way back snapshot for broken link [Local (Regional) Code Enforcement Offices]:
  https://web.archive.org/web/20230311001931/https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/offices/localcode.html

  changed to new page: https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/offices/localcode.shtml


  DEV NOTE for content: previously this was a drop down with 2 CTA buttons, we decided in a meeting to make the the first the CTA link and this one

  callToActionYesText2: Local (Regional) Code Enforcement Offices
  callToActionYesLink2: https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/offices/localcode.shtml

  Needs to be re-worked into the content of the page because we don't like CTA drop downs as a pattern

callToActionLink: "https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/resources/constructionpermitforms.html"
callToActionText: "Construction Permit Application"

Now that you signed your lease, it's time to obtain permits that allow you to build or renovate your site.

### Site Considerations

- []{construction-renovation-site-drawings} **Site drawings:** Hire an architect to create site drawings that meet your business needs and budget
- []{construction-renovation-utilities} **Utilities:** Work with your local government on any utility or water approvals you may need
- []{construction-renovation-permits} **Construction permits:** [File for a construction permit](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/resources/constructionpermitforms.html) with your local government's building/construction department. Before filing, ask the construction department if any prior approvals are required for your industry
- []{construction-renovation-contractors} **Contractors:** Hire any contractors you may need, such as plumbers, electricians, and fire prevention, HVAC or general contractors. Industry best practice is to get 3 quotes before deciding on a contractor

Once you have all the necessary drawings, approvals, and contractors in place, you are in a good position to get your construction or renovation started!
