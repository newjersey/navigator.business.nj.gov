If work must start in less than 10 days, include a letter from the building owner or engineer explaining the emergency. The letter should describe what the emergency is (for example, loss of heat or hot water, flooding that damaged asbestos materials, fire damage, etc.). Explain what could happen if there is a delay. Wait for approval before starting work.
