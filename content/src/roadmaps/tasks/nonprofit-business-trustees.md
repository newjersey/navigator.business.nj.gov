  Now that you've written your bylaws and defined `board of
  trustees|board-trustees` roles, it's time to appoint trustees to take on those
  roles and responsibilities. This is a critical step to ensure your
  organization is governed with the leadership and expertise to succeed.


  At a minimum, a board of trustees typically includes a Chair, Vice Chair, and Treasurer, but it often includes more. For example, you may want to appoint board members with expertise in law, accounting, fundraising, politics, technology, communication—as well as those who understand your mission and have experience running a nonprofit.


  Consider appointing trustees who believe in your cause and are knowledgeable about your mission. This might include existing volunteers, current or potential donors, business leaders, or politicians.
