  Now that you've written your bylaws and defined `board of trustees|board-trustees` roles, it's time to appoint trustees to take on those roles and responsibilities. This is a critical step to ensure your organization is governed with the leadership and expertise to succeed.


  At a minimum, a board of trustees typically includes a Chair, Vice Chair, and Treasurer, but it often includes more. For example, you may want to appoint board members with expertise in law, accounting, fundraising, politics, technology, communicationâ€”as well as those who understand your mission and have experience running a nonprofit.


  Consider appointing trustees who believe in your cause and are knowledgeable about your mission. This might include existing volunteers, current or potential donors, business leaders, or politicians.
