  A Commercial Driver License (CDL) is required to operate large, heavy, or
  specialized commercial vehicles. A business owner only needs a CDL if they
  themselves plan to drive these vehicles. Otherwise, it is their responsibility
  to make sure their drivers have CDLs.


  &nbsp;


  The type of CDL needed depends on vehicle type and endorsement, which are as follows:


  * Class A, for vehicles weighing 26,001 or more and towing a vehicle over 10,000 lbs.

  * Class B, for vehicles weighing 26,001 or more lbs that aren’t towing a heavy trailer.

  * Class B or C with “P” Endorsement, for vehicles designed to transport 16 or more passengers.

  * Class B or C with “S” Endorsement, for school buses used to transport students. **School buses require both an “S” and “P” CDL endorsement.**

  * Class A, B, or C  with “H” Endorsement, for vehicles transporting hazardous materials requiring placards

  * Class A or B with “N” Endorsement, for vehicles carrying liquid cargo in large tanks.

  * Class A with “T” Endorsement, for combination vehicles with two or more trailers.

  * Class A or B with “X” Endorsement, for vehicles that require a combination of Hazmat (“H”) and Tanker (“N”) endorsements, such as fuel tankers and chemical transport trucks

  * Endorsements (“P,” “S,” “H,” “T,” “X”)  are only added to a CDL upon request and require that applicants pass [additional knowledge and skills tests.](https://www.nj.gov/mvc/drivertopics/cdlendorsements.htm)


  * You must apply for a CDL in person. Complete the appropriate form(s) and take them to any NJ MVC vehicle center (or complete the forms on site). Be sure to [make an appointment online](https://telegov.njportal.com/njmvc/AppointmentWizard) before showing up.
