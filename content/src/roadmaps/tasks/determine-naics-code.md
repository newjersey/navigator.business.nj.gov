The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is a system often used to classify a business's industry in the United States. The business owner or representative is responsible for identifying the most accurate classification, symbolized by an 8-digit number.

**There are no benefits or disadvantages to use one NAICS code or another. Your NAICS code selection will not impact your business.**
