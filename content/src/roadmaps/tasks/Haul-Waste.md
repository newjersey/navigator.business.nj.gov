You need to register any vehicle(s) or items you use to haul and discard the waste you create. Vehicle registatraion is required to enter waste facilities. Waste facility vehciles will not allow none registered vehicles to discard waste. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issues a decal that should be placed on any items used for hauling. 

Once your application is submitted and approved, you will recieve an e-mail asking for payment. Your decal(s) will be mailed out the same day as payment was made.

If you collect or haul waste created by other companies, you will need to be a commercial waste hauler, which is a more time-intensive process. 

To complete this application, you must have:
- A completed application
- Affidavit/notarized application
- Valid Motor Vehicle Insurance Card for all vehicles
- Motor Vehicle registration that indicate that the vehicle is registered as Commercial and display 
- Lease agreement and certification (for leased vehicels, if applicable) 
- Home Improvement Contractor registration card
- Copy of the “Certificate of Liability” insurance and bid or contract for demolition (if applicable)

After you complete this task, you will have:
- A DEP account # (If this is your first application with DEP, this will be issued to you once your account is approved.)
- A DEP issued decal for all necessary vehicles
