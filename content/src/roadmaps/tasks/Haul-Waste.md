You need to register any vehicle(s) or items you use to haul and discard the waste you create. Waste facilities will not allow unregistered vehicles or items to discard waste. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) registers vehicles or items used for hauling waste. Once your application is submitted and approved, you will receive an e-mail asking for payment. Your decal(s) will be mailed out the same day as payment was made.

If you collect or haul waste created by other companies, you will need to be a commercial waste hauler, which is a more time-intensive process. 

To complete this application, you must have:
- A completed application
- Affidavit/notarized application
- Motor Vehicle registration that indicates that the vehicle is registered as Commercial
- Valid Motor Vehicle Insurance Card for all vehicles 
- Lease agreement and certification (for leased vehicles, if applicable) 
- Home Improvement Contractor official registration document (also known as a registration card)
- Copy of the “Certificate of Liability” insurance and bid or contract for demolition (if applicable)

After you complete this task, you will have:
- A DEP account # (If this is your first application with DEP, this will be issued to you once your account is approved.)
- A DEP issued decal for all necessary vehicles
