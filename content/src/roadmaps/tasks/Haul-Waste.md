Waste facilities will **only** allow registered vehicles or items to discard waste. You will need to register online and submit payment after you receive an e-mail with payment information.

If you collect or haul waste for other companies, you will need to be a [commercial waste hauler](https://www.wastedecals.nj.gov/swt2.html), which is a more time-intensive process.
