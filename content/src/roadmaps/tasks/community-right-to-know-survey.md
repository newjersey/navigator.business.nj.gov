## Survey and Exemption Requirements

Complete the survey by March 1 each year if your facility had any EHS above a specific threshold at any time during the previous calendar year. You must complete a survey for each location where your business operates.

Complete an exemption form if any of the following are true:

* Your building is an administrative site only
* Your building has no EHS
* Your building has EHS below the threshold
* Your building has no staff on-site

Note: If you complete an exemption form and CRTK says your business is exempt, you do not need to complete an exemption form every year.
