## Survey or Exemption Requirements

Complete the survey every year by March 1 if your facility has any EHS above a specific threshold at any time. You must complete a survey for each location where your business operates.

Complete an exemption form if any of the following are true:

- Your building has no EHS

- Your building has EHS below the threshold

- Your building has no staff on-site

Note: If you complete an exemption form and CRTK says your business is exempt, you do not need to complete an exemption form every year.
