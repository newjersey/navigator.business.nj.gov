## Insurance Considerations

- **Commercial general liability insurance:** Confirm that your coverage includes work done in New Jersey
- **`Workers' compensation insurance|workers-comp`**: The State of New Jersey requires that you obtain this insurance if you have NJ employees, or stockholders in a corporation do work for the company (even if they are not compensated).
