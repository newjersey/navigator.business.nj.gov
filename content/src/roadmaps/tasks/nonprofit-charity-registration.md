If your business is a charity or non-profit organization that receives $10,000 or more in public funding and/or uses a professional fundraiser to raise money, you need to register as a charity with the State. 

The charity registration is a two-part online registration process. In part 1, you create a profile, add basic charity details, such as your charity name and EIN, and request portal access. During part 2, you register your business by submitting more in-depth information about the charity and all the required documentation.

:::infoAlert 
 You have 30 days to register once your business receives $10,000 in public funding.
