  After the Division of Consumer Affairs receives and confirms all materials are
  submitted for your shop license, you need to have the site inspected.


  To complete your requirements as a cosmetology business, an inspector from the New Jersey Division's Enforcement Bureau will visit the shop location to determine compliance. Read the [cosmetology shop regulations](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/regulations/Chapter-28-Board-of-Cosmetology-and-Hairstyling.pdf) to make sure you are prepared. The Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling will contact your shop to schedule an inspection after your shop license application is complete.
