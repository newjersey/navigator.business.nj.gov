After the Division of Consumer Affairs has received and reviewed your shop license application and confirmed all materials were submitted, you need to have the site inspected.

To complete your requirements as a cosmetology business, an inspector from the New Jersey Division's Enforcement Bureau will visit the shop location to determine compliance. Read the [cosmetology shop regulations](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/regulations/Chapter-28-Board-of-Cosmetology-and-Hairstyling.pdf) to make sure you are prepared. The Board will contact your shop to schedule an inspection after your shop license application is complete.

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A cosmetology shop license
