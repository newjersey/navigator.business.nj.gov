## Site Requirements

- [DCF’s licensing manual](https://www.nj.gov/dcf/providers/licensing/laws/CCCmanual.pdf) has site requirements based on the number of children and their ages:

  - **Institutional (I-4)**: One or more children younger than 2 ½ years
  - **Educational (E)**: Six or more children 2 ½ years or older
  - **Assembly: (A-3 or A-4)**: School-aged child care program

- **`Certificate of Occupancy/Approval|certificate-occupancy`**: For new site buildings or if you've completed site renovations, you need to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy or Approval from your local building/construction department.
- **Fire protection permits**: Talk to your fire department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage
- **Signage**: Speak to your local zoning office and building/construction department to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted
- **Construction permits**: Check with your local government's building/construction department for any permit requirements prior to starting renovations. Find out the requirements for a construction permit at your site
- **`Life Hazard Use|life-hazard-use` registration**: Register as a Life Hazard Use and pay the registration fee on the state [Division of Fire Safety online service portal](https://firesolutions.dca.nj.gov/ultra-fire-home/). Your business use determines when and how often your routine fire inspections will occur once your business is up and running.

You can schedule a free preliminary inspection with DCF's Office of Licensing at 1-877-667-9845.
