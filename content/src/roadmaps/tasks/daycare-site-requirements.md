## DCF Requirements

- [DCF’s licensing manual](https://www.nj.gov/dcf/providers/licensing/laws/CCCmanual.pdf) has site requirements based on the number of children and their ages.

## Building Requirements

- **Fire protection permits**: Talk to your fire department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage.
- **Signage**: Speak to your local zoning office and building/construction department to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted.
- **Construction permits**: Check with your local government's building/construction department for any permit requirements prior to starting renovations. Find out the requirements for a construction permit at your site.
- **`Certificate of Occupancy/Approval|certificate-occupancy`**: For new site buildings or if you've completed site renovations, you need to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy or Approval from your local building/construction department.
- **`Life Hazard Use|life-hazard-use` registration**: Register as a Life Hazard Use and pay the registration fee on the state [Division of Fire Safety online service portal](https://firesolutions.dca.nj.gov/ultra-fire-home/). Your business use determines when and how often your routine fire inspections will occur once your business is up and running.

## Environmental Requirements

- **`Response Action Outcome (RAO)|response-action-outcome`**: An RAO shows that a site is environmentally safe.
  To get an RAO, hire a `Licensed Site Remediation Professional (LSRP)|licensed-site-remediation-professional` . Ask them to do a Preliminary Assessment (PA) of your site so that you can get an RAO.
