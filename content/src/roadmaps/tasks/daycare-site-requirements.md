Before opening your daycare, New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF) and your local government have to inspect your daycare.

### Site Requirements

- [DCF’s licensing manual](https://www.nj.gov/dcf/providers/licensing/laws/CCCmanual.pdf) has site requirements based on the number of children and their ages:

  - **Institutional (I-4)**: One or more children younger than 2 ½ years
  - **Educational (E)**: Six or more children 2 ½ years or older
  - **Assembly: (A-3 or A-4)**: School-aged child care program

- **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** For new site buildings or if you've completed site renovations, you need to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy\` from your local building/construction department.
- **Fire prevention permits:** Talk to your fire department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage
- **Signage:** Speak to your local zoning office and building/construction department to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted
- **Construction permits:** Check with your local government's building/construction department for any permit requirements prior to starting renovations. Find out the requirements for a construction permit at your site

You can schedule a free preliminary inspection with DCF's Office of Licensing at 1-877-667-9845.
