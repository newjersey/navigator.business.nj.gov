summaryDescriptionMd: A reseller is a business that chooses to sell items or
  services sold by another company. If you plan to resell goods or services,
  present a completed [Resale Certificate
  form](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/other_forms/sales/st3.pdf)
  to the seller to give you tax-exemption, so you are not responsible for paying
  sales tax. You do not need to mail this form to the State. The business
  selling goods or services to the end buyer is responsible for collecting and
  filing the sales tax. You will be asked about this when you register for
  taxes.
