A reseller is a business that chooses to sell items or services sold by another company. If you plan to resell goods or services, present a completed [Resale Certificate form](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/other_forms/sales/st3.pdf) to the seller to give you tax-exemption. The business selling goods or services to the end buyer is responsible for collecting and filing the sales tax. You will be asked about this when you register for taxes.
