  If your business buys items for resale, you need to complete the Sales Tax
  Resale Certificate. You also need to complete this certificate if you buy
  items to use in products for resale (for example, if you buy t-shirts for a
  screen printing business). This certificate allows you to buy items for resale
  without paying sales tax.

   &nbsp;

  You cannot use the Sales Tax Resale Certificate for items or equipment that you will not resell. For example, if you are an electronics retailer who buys computers to resell, you cannot use the resale certificate to buy a computer to use in your home or office.
