  Insurance will protect your business assets should you be held liable for an
  incident. You will also need proof of insurance to register your commercial
  vehicle with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.


  To find an insurance broker, speak to your network, local Chamber of Commerce, or supplier. Oftentimes, the best way to find a broker is through word of mouth.
