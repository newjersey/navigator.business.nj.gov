## Site Selection Considerations

* **Define your goals**: Decide on your investment goals and type of property you want to buy, such as a single-family home, multi-family unit, or apartment building. Clarifying your goals will help you focus your search and decision-making.
* **Set a budget**: Determine how much you can spend on the property. Include extra costs like closing expenses, inspections, and possible renovations.
* **Get financing**: Secure a loan or funding. Contact banks, mortgage lenders, or private investors to get pre-approved.
* **Assemble a team of professionals**: Get help from experts on the buying process. Talk to a real estate agent, a real estate attorney, and possibly a property inspector and appraiser.
* **Search for properties**: Work with a real estate agent to find properties that fit your needs. Your agent will show you property listings, arrange tours, and help you assess them.
* **Conduct due diligence**: Inspect the property and review financial documents thoroughly. Also, check zoning laws and confirm the property's legal status.
* **Negotiate the purchase**: Discuss and agree on terms with the seller, including the price, closing date, and any other conditions. Your real estate attorney can help with this.
* **Sign a purchase agreement**: Once both parties agree on the terms, sign a formal purchase agreement or sales contract. This legally binds both parties to the agreed-upon terms and sets the stage for the closing.
* **Complete financing and contingencies**: Finalize your financing arrangements. Also, work through any contingencies in the agreement, like getting permits or approvals.
* **Conduct a title search**: Make sure there are no outstanding liens or ownership issues with the property.
* **Get title insurance**: Get title insurance to protect against unexpected title problems.
