A business bank account separates your business finances from your personal expenses. This helps you keep accurate and organized accounting records for tax purposes and business operations.

Cannabis is not legal at the federal level. For this reason, FDIC-insured banks are not able to open accounts for cannabis businesses. Confirm the bank is able to service cannabis businesses, their document requirements, services, and fees.  

**Note:** Private financing is not the same as a business bank account.
