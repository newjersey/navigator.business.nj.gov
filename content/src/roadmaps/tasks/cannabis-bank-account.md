A business bank account separates your business finances from your personal expenses. This helps you keep accurate and organized accounting records for tax purposes and business operations.

Cannabis is not legal at the federal level. For this reason, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - insured (FDIC)  banks cannot open accounts for cannabis businesses. Confirm your bank is able to service cannabis businesses, their document requirements, services, and fees.  

:::infoAlert 
 Private financing is not the same as a business bank account.
