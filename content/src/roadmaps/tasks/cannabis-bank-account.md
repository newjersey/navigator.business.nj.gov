  A business bank account separates your business finances from your personal expenses. This helps you keep
  accurate and organized accounting records for tax purposes and business operations.

  Cannabis is not legal at the federal level. For this reason, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - insured
  (FDIC) banks cannot open accounts for cannabis businesses. Confirm your bank is able to service cannabis
  businesses, their document requirements, services, and fees.
