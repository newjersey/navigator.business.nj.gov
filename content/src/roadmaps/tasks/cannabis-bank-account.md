  A business bank account separates your business finances from your personal
  expenses. This helps you keep accurate and organized accounting records for
  tax purposes and business operations.

  Cannabis is not legal at the federal level. For this reason, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - insured (FDIC) banks cannot open accounts for cannabis businesses. Confirm your bank is able to service cannabis businesses, their document requirements, services, and fees.
