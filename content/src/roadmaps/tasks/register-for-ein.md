An `Employer Identification Number (EIN)|ein` is essentially a Social Security Number for your business, provided by the federal government. We recommend that most businesses obtain an EIN from the IRS so that you don't need to use your personal personal SSN on tax filings and other business registrations. If you plan on having employees you will need an EIN. The form you use to file an EIN is often referred to as SS-4.

To complete this application, you must have:

* Identified an available business name

After you complete this task, you will have:

* An EIN
* An EIN Certificate (the document indicating your EIN)
