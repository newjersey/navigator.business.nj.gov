You and/or your staff will need to have individual cosmetology licenses. If the business owner does not have a cosmetology license, the shop manager must have a license and at least 2 years of experience.

Licenses are required for cosmetologists, hairstylists, manicurists, skincare specialists, barbers, hair braiders, and beauticians. It is the shop owner's responsibility to ensure their staff is licensed.
