If your business will offer spray paint services to vehicles, you must speak with a representative at the Office of Permitting and Project Navigation at the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Below we list a few permits DEP may require from your business:

1. **Air Permitting**: Due to potential chemicals spray paint emits.
2. **Hazardous Waste**: Related to potential paint solvents and material waste.
3. **New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES)**: Caused by potential discharge water from your facility.
4. **Wetlands, Existing Flood Hazard Areas**: Related to potential disturbances caused by your business.
5. **Right to Know**: Due to hazardous material which may be stored on the site. 

Contact DEP's Office of Permitting and Project Navigation at (609)292-3600 for additional guidance on your permitting needs.
