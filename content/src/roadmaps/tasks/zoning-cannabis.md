  To obtain a cannabis license, you need zoning approval and a letter of resolution of support from your local
  government. The resolution of support is proof that your local government approves and is in support of your
  cannabis business. This letter is a requirement for your cannabis license application, and it's used as
  evidence that you obtained your local government's approval.

  To complete this task you must meet with your local clerk, planner, engineer, and zoning officer.
