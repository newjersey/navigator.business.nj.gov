Prior to opening, you may need to get a mercantile license. A mercantile license helps your local government track businesses in the area. Not all cities and towns require a mercantile license, you will want to check your local ordinance or contact your local clerk's office.

You can find your city or town clerk through either the [${municipality} website](${municipalityWebsite}) or by contacting your [county clerk](${countyClerkWebsite}) (which is different from your city/town clerk) at ${countyClerkPhone}.

After you complete this task (if applicable), you will have:

- A Mercantile License
