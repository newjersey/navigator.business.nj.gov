  SME feedback, **From:** Friedmann, Brian \[TREAS] [Brian.Friedmann@treas.nj.gov](mailto:Brian.Friedmann@treas.nj.gov)\

  1.        ‘Tobacco products’ must be replaced with ‘cigarettes’ throughout the document. 


  This license is for rolled cigarettes only.  Other tobacco products do not require this license to be sold.


  2.       The manufacturer representative line should have ‘if applicable’ added to the end and ‘address of machine location’ removed. 


  Both this and the supplier information are only needed if applicable to the license type selected at the top of the application.


  3.       If needed there should be a bullet for vending machine license which states what information is needed.


  4.       Under “once completed…”, it should be changed to say “A printed license will be sent directly to your business location.”

  You need a cigarette license to do either of the following in New Jersey:


  * sell or manufacture cigarettes

  * have a vending machine with cigarettes


  If you sell container e-liquid and plan to have more than 50% of your retail sales come from electronic smoking devices, related accessories, and/or liquid nicotine, you must [apply for a Vapor Business License with the NJ Division of Taxation](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/pdf/other_forms/tobacco/vb-r.pdf).


  <br><br>


  If you are a manufacturer (not a manufacturer representative), you must [submit an application with the NJ Division of Taxation] (https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/prnttobacco.shtml).
