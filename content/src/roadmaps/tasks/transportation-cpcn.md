  To legally provide transportation services in New Jersey, you need a
  Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN). This certificate shows
  that you have legal authority by the state to engage in transportation
  services.


  :::infoAlert 

  New or recently acquired, qualifying vehicles must obtain the CPCN **before scheduling the vehicle’s initial inspection, and before registering the vehicle with the MVC for plates.**

  :::


  Passenger transport vehicles requiring the CPCN include those that:


  * Transport passengers for compensation, such as transit buses

  * Follow a fixed route or schedule

  * Provide group transport open to the public or for compensation, such as shuttle services
