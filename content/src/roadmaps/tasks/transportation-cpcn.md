  To provide transportation services in New Jersey, you need a Certificate of
  Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN). This certificate serves as proof that
  you have legal authority by the state to do so.


  :::infoAlert 

  New or recently acquired, qualifying vehicles must obtain the CPCN before scheduling the vehicle’s initial inspection, and before registering the vehicle with the MVC for plates.

  :::


  Transportation services that require a CPCN include:


  * **Intrastate Regular Route Operations,** which consists of carrying passengers on a regular schedule between fixed points in NJ for compensation. This service can be open to the public or restricted to a specific group.

  * **Casino Bus Operations,** which consists of carrying passengers to and from one or more casinos in Atlantic City.

  * **Special Bus Operations,** which consists of carrying passengers, not on a regular schedule, to or from a place in NJ for per-person compensation. The compensation may include special discounts or premiums for attractions that are served by the route. These trips are offered and arranged by the owner of the bus company.


  Transportation services that do not require the CPCN include: 

  * Taxicabs

  * Limousines

  * School buses

  * Inter-state regular route services

  * Charter buses
