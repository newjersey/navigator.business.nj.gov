  To provide transportation services in New Jersey, you need a Certificate of
  Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN). This certificate shows that you have
  authority by the state to legally engage in said services.


  :::infoAlert 

  New or recently acquired, qualifying vehicles must obtain the CPCN **before scheduling the vehicle’s initial inspection, and before registering the vehicle with the MVC for plates.**

  :::


  Vehicles requiring the CPCN include those that:


  * Transport passengers for compensation, such as transit buses

  * Follow a fixed route or schedule

  * Provide group transport open to the public or for compensation, such as shuttle services or jitneys
