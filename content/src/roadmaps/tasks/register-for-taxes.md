It's time to register your business for State taxes with the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services. Doing so will tell the State more about your business and determine what taxes and employer contributions you're liable for. The form you will be filing for this task is often referred to as NJ-Reg.

To complete this application, you must have:

- `Entity ID|entity-id` (not required for general partnership or sole proprietorship)
- `NAICS code|naics`
- `EIN|ein`
- Estimated start date
- Description of your business activity
- Estimated number of employees
- Anticipated first payroll withholding date for employees (if applicable)
- Information on if and when you expect to report and collect sales tax
- Owner information
- Mail to address and business location(s)
- Other taxes you may collect (i.e. motor fuels and cigarette/tobacco taxes), a list will be provided

After you complete this task, you will have:

- `Business Registration Certificate (BRC)|business-reg-certificate`
- NJ Tax ID
- `Business Tax PIN|tax-pin`
- Authorization to Collect Sales Tax (if applicable)
