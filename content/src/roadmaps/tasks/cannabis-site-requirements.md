## Safety Permits

1. **Fire protection permits:** Talk to your fire department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage.
2. **Store signage:** Speak to your local zoning office, building/construction department, and NJCRC to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted.
3. **Construction permits:** Check with your local government's building/construction department for permit requirements prior to starting renovations. Find out the [requirements for a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections) at your site.
4. **`Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy`:** Speak to your local building/construction department to certify that your space is safe for occupancy.
5. **`Life Hazard Use|life-hazard-use` or `Non-Life Hazard Use|non-life-hazard-use` registration:** Contact your `Local Enforcing Agency|lea` to see if you need to register as a Life Hazard Use or Non-Life Hazard Use. Your Use Type depends on whether your business poses a significant fire hazard. Once your Use Type is identified, you will need to register and potentially make construction improvements to your site. Once your business is up and running, your Use Type will determine when and how often your routine fire inspections will occur.
