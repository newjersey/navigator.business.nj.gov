  To obtain a `conversion|cannabis-conditional-license` or `annual cannabis
  license|cannabis-annual-license`, you must meet all local requirements for
  your cannabis site. Speak to your local government to determine specific
  requirements. Your site should also comply with New Jersey's [Cannabis
  Regulatory Commission (CRC) site requirements
  (p.59)](https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/documents/CREAMM%20Act.PDF)


  Before opening, your site must be inspected and approved locally and by the CRC to ensure customer and employee safety. The CRC inspection takes place after they approve your conversion or annual license application, but before issuing your license.

## Safety Permits

- **Fire protection permits:** Talk to your fire department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage
- **Signage:** Speak to your local zoning office, building/construction department, and the CRC to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted
- **Construction permits:** Check with your local building/construction department for permit requirements before doing any construction. Find out the [requirements for a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections) at your site
- **`Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy`:** Speak to your local building/construction department to certify that your space is safe for occupancy
- **`Life Hazard Use|life-hazard-use` or `Non-Life Hazard Use|non-life-hazard-use` registration:** Contact your `Local Enforcing Agency|lea` to see if you need to register as a Life Hazard Use or Non-Life Hazard Use. Your use type depends on whether your business poses a significant fire hazard. Your use type determines when and how often your fire inspections will occur once your site is open
