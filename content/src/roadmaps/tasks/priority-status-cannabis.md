Your business may qualify for priority status in the Cannabis application process. This means your application will be reviewed earlier than other applications. Learn more about how [priority status](https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/businesses/priority-applications/) is reviewed and approved.

### Priority Types

Diversely-owned businesses are given the highest priority followed by social-equity businesses. Having multiple priorities is not an advantage. Identify which of the following priorities you qualify for:

- `Diversely Owned Businesses|diversely-owned-business-cannabis`
- `Social Equity Businesses|social-equity-business-cannabis`
- `Impact Zone Businesses|impact-zone-business-cannabis`

### How to prove your priority status?

If you have a Diversely Owned Business, you must [apply for certification](https://www.njportal.com/DOR/SBERegistry/) from the New Jersey Department of Treasury.

If you are a Social Equity Business or an Impact Zone Business you do not need to apply to anything now, but you will be asked unique questions in your Cannabis application.
