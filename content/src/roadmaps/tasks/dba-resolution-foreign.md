To form your business in New Jersey, you need to obtain a resolution adopting your Doing Business As (DBA) name.

Your operating agreement or bylaws should tell you how to get a resolution. For LLCs, this might mean creating a statement of intent and having it signed by all members, for Corporations, this might mean getting board approval.

You will need to share a copy of the resolution with the New Jersey Department of Treasury when you form your business.
