summaryDescriptionMd: >-
  If your business is based in New Jersey but you also sell in more than one
  state, you can register for sales taxes in multiple states at the same time
  through the Streamlined Sales Tax Registration System (SSTRS).


  &nbsp;


  New Jersey, along with many other states, is part of the Streamlined Sales Tax program (SST). If you sell in SST states, you can register for sales taxes in those states through SSTRS. This can help you save time and avoid confusion. 


  &nbsp;


  `Marketplace facilitators|marketplace-facilitator` and `marketplace sellers|marketplace-seller` can also register through SSTRS.
