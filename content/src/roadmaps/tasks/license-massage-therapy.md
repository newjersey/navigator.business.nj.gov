You must register and apply for a massage therapy license online through the Division of Consumer Affairs' Board of Massage and Bodywork Therapy. If you do not register, you will be working illegally and can receive a fine.

* A minimum of 500 hours from an approved massage therapy program
* An official transcript sent by your school in a sealed envelope
* A [Supervision Certification](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/mbt/Applications/Supervising-Faculty-Member-Certification.pdf) form completed by a licensed massage and bodywork therapist who has supervised the required 100 hours of clinical practice
* Passing scores on the certification exam from the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB), or
* Passing scores on the certification exam (MBLEx) from the Federation of State Massage Therapy Board (FSMTB)Â 

Your official examination scores will need to be sent directly to the board in a sealed envelope.

After you complete this task, you will have:

* A confirmation letter (sent via postal mail) with your massage therapy license number
