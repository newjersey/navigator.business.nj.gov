The New Jersey Board of Massage and Bodywork Therapy is responsible for registering and licensing certified massage therapists. You may register and apply for a massage therapy license online through the Division of Consumer Affairs. If you do not register, you will be working illegally and can receive a fine.

To apply for a massage therapy license you will need:

* A minimum of 500 hours from an approved massage therapy program
* A [Supervision Certification](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/mbt/Applications/Supervising-Faculty-Member-Certification.pdf) form completed by a licensed massage and bodywork therapist who has supervised the required 100 hours of clinical practice
* Passing scores on the certification exam from the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB), or
* Passing scores on the certification exam(MBLEx) from the Federation of State Massage Therapy Board (FSMTB) 

You will need to request your school to submit an official transcript and the supervision certification directly to the New Jersey Board of Massage and Bodywork Therapy in a sealed envelope. Your official examination scores will also need to be sent directly to the board in a sealed envelope.

Your school transcripts, supervision certification, and examination scores can be mailed to:

124 Halsey Street, 6th Floor

P.O. Box 47032
