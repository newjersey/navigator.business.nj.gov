- **Store signage:** Speak to your local zoning office and building/construction department to make sure the signage you're proposing is allowed
- **Construction permits:** Check if you need a building/construction permit with your local government's building/construction department before starting any renovations. Find out the [requirements for a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections) at your site
- **Certificate of Occupancy or Approval:** Speak to your local building/construction department to certify that your space is safe for occupancy. **This is required by the Division of Consumer Affairs for a shop license**
- **`Non-Life Hazard Use|non-life-hazard-use` registration:** Contact your `Local Enforcing Agency|lea` to see if you need to register as a Non-Life Hazard Use business to operate and comply with fire safety regulations. After registration, your business will be added to the schedule for routine fire inspections
