The Blanket of Coverage (BOC-3) designates a process agent for your company that can file and receive legal documents on your behalf. 
 
You can only file a Blanket of Coverage for yourself if youâ€™re a broker or a freight forwarder. If you do any type of load-hauling for your company, you need to select a process agent and have them file the BOC-3 for your company. 
 
To find a process agent speak to your network, or check the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) list of process agent companies. 
 
**Note:** you will need a process agent in each state you do business
