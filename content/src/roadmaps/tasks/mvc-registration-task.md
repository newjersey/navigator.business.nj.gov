  * A Motor Vehicle Commission

  (MVC) Entity Identification Number (EIN) is required before registering a vehicle


  * You must apply for a title in person. Complete the appropriate form(s) and take them to any NJ MVC vehicle center (or complete the forms on site). Be sure to [make an appointment online](https://telegov.njportal.com/njmvc/AppointmentWizard/8) before showing up.


  :::


  Your business vehicles must have a valid license plate and registration card to be legally driven on public roads. This includes:


  * Trucks, vans, or other vehicles that exceed a certain weight limit (usually over 10,000 pounds)

  * Vehicles used to carry freight

  * Vehicles used to carry passengers, such as taxis, limousines, and buses


  Typically,  when you purchase a new vehicle from a New Jersey dealer, **they register it for you as part of the sales process.** If you opt out, or have a vehicle that was registered out of state, you, as the buyer, are responsible for registering it in NJ.
