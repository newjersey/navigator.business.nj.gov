Not all businesses need zoning or sign permits. If you are changing the use of your site—for example, if the site was previously a pork roll manufacturer, and it will now be a pizza place—you may need to get zoning approval. Similarly, if you're changing the size or location of your street sign, you may need local government approval. It's time to get:

1. **Zoning Permits/Approval:** Obtain zoning approval from your local Zoning Office.
2. **Sign Permits:** Obtain signage approvals from your local Building/Construction Department or Zoning Office.

After you complete this task (if applicable), you will have:

- Zoning approval
- Sign permits
