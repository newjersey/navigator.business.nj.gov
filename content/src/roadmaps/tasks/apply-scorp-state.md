S corporation designation at the state level allows your business to avoid double taxation on corporate income by passing it onto the shareholders to be taxed at their individual tax rates. Filing for S corporation designation at the state level is a separate process than requesting the designation at a federal level. If you do not file for an S corporation designation at the State but choose to pay taxes under this structure, you could be liable for fees associated with improperly filing taxes.

For the election to be in effect for the current tax year, you must file the application within 3 ½ months of the start of your fiscal year. Once your application is accepted, a corporation may remain an S corporation in New Jersey for as long as it remains an S corporation at the federal level.

To apply for an S corporation designation in the State of New Jersey you will need to:
- Obtain permission from all the stakeholders to file for an S corporation designation
- Apply for an S corporation designation at the federal level with the Internal Revenue Service
- Register with the NJ Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services
- Have received your Certificate of Incorporation and Certificate of Authority to do business in the state of New Jersey
  
After you’ve completed this task you will have:
- An S corporation designation with the State of New Jersey
