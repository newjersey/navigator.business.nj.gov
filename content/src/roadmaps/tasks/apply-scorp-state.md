Filing for S corporation designation at the state level is a separate process than requesting the designation at a federal level. If you do not file for an S corporation designation at the State but choose to pay taxes under this structure, you could be liable for fees associated with improperly filing taxes.

For the election to be in effect for the current tax year, you must file the application within 3 ½ months of the start of your fiscal year. Once your application is accepted, a corporation may remain an S corporation in New Jersey for as long as it remains an S corporation at the federal level.

To apply for an S corporation designation in the State of New Jersey you will need:

* Signatures from all company shareholders granting permission to file for an S corp designation
* An existing S corp designation at the federal level
* `Entity ID|entity-id`

After you’ve completed this task you will have:

* A letter confirming your business' election to file taxes as an S Corporation with the State of New Jersey
