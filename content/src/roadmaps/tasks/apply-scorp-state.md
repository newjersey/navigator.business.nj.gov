Filing for an `S corporation|s-corp` designation at the state level is a separate process from requesting the designation at a federal level. If you do not file for an S corp designation with the State but choose to pay taxes under this structure, you could be liable for fees associated with improperly filing taxes.

For the election to be in effect for the current tax year, you must file the application within 3 ½ months of the start of your fiscal year.

To complete this application, you must have:

* Signatures from all company shareholders granting permission to file for an S corp designation
* An existing S corp designation with the IRS
* `Entity ID|entity-id`

After you’ve completed this task you will have:

* A letter confirming your S corp status with the State of New Jersey
