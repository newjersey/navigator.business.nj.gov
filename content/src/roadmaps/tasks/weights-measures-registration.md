  25 June 2024: Revisions made to address SME comments from Jason Flint:


  * This is technically a registration, not a license.  I would replace all mentions of “license” with “registration”

  * If someone doesn’t get the registration, in addition to being subject to fines, they will also have to pay late fees

  * Somewhere in your document, I would stress that all applications must be filled out in their entirety and submitted with all applicable fees.  Failure to do so will result in the application and check/money order being returned and the business will remain unregistered.

  * At this moment, OWM is only able to receive checks or money orders for payment.  Not sure if you want to include that in your document

    1. How long does a registration last? The registration lasts one year, from February 1 to January 31.
    2. Will you confirm that the renewal process is identical to the initial application for registering a commercial weighing or measuring device? The initial application process is completed on a Registration Application Form.  The renewals may be submitted on the same form, however, a renewal application is sent out via mail in November or December of each year to all businesses that have registered the year prior.
    3. What do they receive when they successfully register a device? What do they receive when they renew that registration?  When a business submits their initial or renewal application, along with required fees, they will receive a Registration Certificate via mail.
    4. Of the following list of industries, which ones would be likely to have a commercial weighing and measuring device?  I have attached a list of business types that we keep track of internally that may have to register devices if they are used commercially.
summaryDescriptionMd: >
  You must register any commercial weighing or measuring devices you plan to use
  for your business. This includes scales, meters, and other weighing or
  measuring devices.
