  All drivers (limo, taxi, rental car chauffeur) need to have a letter of
  certification before they can legally operate company vehicles. It’s the
  employer’s responsibility to file an application for a driver's certification
  if the driver doesn't already have one.

  (Only drivers holding a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with a Passenger (P) endorsement are exempt from this requirement.)
