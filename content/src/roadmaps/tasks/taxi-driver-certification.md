  Drivers that already have a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with a Passenger "P" endorsement are exempt from this requirement.


  :::


  All drivers of vehicles designed to transport **16 or more passengers,** such as limos, taxis, and rental cars, need to have a letter of certification before they can legally operate company vehicles. It’s the employer’s responsibility to file an application for a driver's certification if the driver doesn't already have one.
