All drivers need to have a letter of certification before they can legally operate company vehicles. It’s the employer’s responsibility to file an application for a driver's certification if the driver doesn't already have one.

**Note:** Only drivers holding a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with a Passenger (P) endorsement are exempt from this requirement.
