School bus drivers need a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with a Passenger (P) and School Bus (S) endorsement before they can legally drive a school bus. The licensing process has two parts: knowledge and skills tests.

**Note:** P and S endorsements are only added to a CDL upon request and require that you take a specific knowledge and skills test.

Employers must do a background check on all potential drivers. Only drivers with clean records can legally drive a school bus.
