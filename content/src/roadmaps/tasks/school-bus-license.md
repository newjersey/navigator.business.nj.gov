Employers must do a background check on all potential drivers. Only drivers with clean records can legally drive a school bus.

School bus drivers need a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with a Passenger (P) and School Bus (S) endorsement before they can legally drive a school bus. The licensing process has two parts: knowledge and skills tests.

:::infoAlert 
 P and S endorsements are only added to a CDL upon request and require that you take a separate, additional knowledge and skills test.
