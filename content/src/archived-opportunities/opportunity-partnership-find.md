Opportunity Partnership helps employers identify an appropriate educational institution or training provider to train employees. The business and the school together develop training programs to teach needed skills you. Upon completing the program, trainees must qualify for entry-level positions in your company.

**Benefits:** Company-tailored training to ensure an appropriate pipeline of employees.

**Eligibility:** Any business can be part of the application (though apprenticeship programs are the applicant). Funding is tied to individuals/future employees, not businesses.
