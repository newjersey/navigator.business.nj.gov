The Brownfields Impact Fund is a pilot program, funded by the federal Environmental Protection Agency's Revolving Loan Fund grant, that will provide $800,000 in funding for loans to private developers and loans and/or sub-grants to public sector and non-profits to carry out cleanups at brownfield sites.
