The Return and Earn program is a grant for employers who hire unemployed workers, train them, and provide those workers with a new skill required for the job.

**Benefits:** Employers can receive up to 50% wage subsidy for up to 6 months (cap of $10,000 per employee, total cap of $40,000 across all employees). Employees: $500 incentive for re-entering the workforce and receiving training from businesses with 100 or fewer employees. 

**Eligibility:** Employers with 100 or fewer employees registered with the State of NJ and who will provide substantive on-the-job training at their location or, depending on circumstances, utilize approved virtual training, that results in skill badges or industry-recognized credentials.
