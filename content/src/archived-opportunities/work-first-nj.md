Work First NJ provides skills, training, and education opportunities to SNAP and TANF recipients. The focus of the program is to provide skills-based programs with a job-driven approach utilizing resources and expertise to prepare individuals who receive SNAP or TANF resources to fill areas of demand for a trained workforce. Not all programs need to be designed from scratch, some employment and training programs already exist, in which case, this program may suggest skilled workers for hire.

Interested individuals should contact Ahmad McDougle wfnj@dol.nj.gov
