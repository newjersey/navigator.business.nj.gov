## **Submit Your Apprenticeship Program Intake Form**

You can start a registered apprenticeship program within your business through the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). An apprenticeship program combines paid on-the-job training and classroom instruction.

You can develop the training to align with your business needs. That way, you are helping to develop skilled employees while ensuring they are completing work that meets business needs.

Connecting with the New Jersey DOL Office of Apprenticeship is the **first** step in the process. They will walk you through the registration process and your responsibilities as a program sponsor.

You will then work with a representative from USDOL to develop and register your program.

:::infoAlert
You will need to have an approved apprenticeship program to register as a public works contractor.
