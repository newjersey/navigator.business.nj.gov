## **Ensure Your Staff Has Prevailing Wage**

Per the [NJ State Prevailing Wage Act](https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/tools-resources/laws/prevailingwageact.shtml), the NJ Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJ DOL) determines the `prevailing wage|prevailing-wage` on `public works|public-works` projects.

If you are interested in working on `public works|public-works` contracts, you must register with the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance within the NJ DOL. The Public Works Contractor Registration Act requires registration.

You must submit certified payroll records for each employee within ten days of the payment of wages. You can either submit the [MW-562](<https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/assets/PDFs/wagehub/MW-562%20(6-23)%20PayrollCert-PublicWorks.pdf>) form, or submit online via the [NJ Wage](https://njwages.nj.gov/) Hub. Effective August 15, 2024, certified payroll records will only be accepted online.

Also, you must maintain the following records for a two-year period from the date of payment:

- Employee information, such as Social Security number (SSN) and job trade
- Rates of pay
  - Hourly
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Overtime
- Itemized deductions
- Net pay
