  If your Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) registration expired less than
  30 days ago, [you can renew online](https://newjersey.mylicense.com/). If it
  has been expired for more than 30 days or is inactive, you need to reinstate
  it by following these steps:


  1. Ensure you are registered with the [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html) before applying for your CDS reinstatement.

  2. Email the New Jersey Drug Control Unit (DCU) at [cds@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) to request the Facilities Reinstatement application.

  3. After your completed application has been emailed back to the DCU, they will email you an invoice to pay the fee online.
