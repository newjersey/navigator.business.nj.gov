summaryDescriptionMd: >-
  If your Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) registration expired less than
  30 days ago, [you can renew online](https://newjersey.mylicense.com/). If it
  has been expired for more than 30 days or is inactive, you need to reinstate
  it by following these steps:


  1. Email The New Jersey Drug Control Unit (DCU) at [cds@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) to request the Facilities Reinstatement application.

  2. After your completed application has been emailed back to the DCU, they will send you an invoice via email to pay the fee online.

  3. If your [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html) registration is also expired, be sure to reinstate it.
