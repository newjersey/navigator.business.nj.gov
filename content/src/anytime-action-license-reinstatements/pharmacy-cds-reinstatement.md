summaryDescriptionMd: >
  If your CDS registration expired less than 30 days ago, [you can renew
  online](https://newjersey.mylicense.com/). If it has been expired for more
  than 30 days or is inactive, you need to reinstate it by following these
  steps:

  1. Ensure you are registered with the [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html) before applying for your CDS reinstatement. 

  2. Email The NJ Drug Control Unit (DCU) at [CDS@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) to request the Facilities Reinstatement application.

  3. After your completed application has been emailed back to the DCU, they will send you an invoice to pay the fee online.
