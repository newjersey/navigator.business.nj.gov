  If your Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) registration expired less than

  has been expired for more than 30 days or is inactive, you need to reinstate
  it by following these steps:


  1. Email the New Jersey Drug Control Unit (DCU) at [cds@dca.njoag.gov](mailto:CDS@dca.njoag.gov) to request the Facilities Reinstatement application.

  2. After your completed application has been emailed to the DCU, they will email you an invoice to pay the fee online.

  3. If your [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html) registration is also expired, be sure to reinstate it.
