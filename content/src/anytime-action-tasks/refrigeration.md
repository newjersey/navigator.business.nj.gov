## Refrigeration Systems That Need Inspection

Refrigeration systems using **flammable or toxic refrigerants** must be inspected if they:

- Use over 3 tons of refrigerating capacity, **or**
- Require over 6 driving horsepower

Refrigeration systems using **nonflammable and nontoxic refrigerants** that have a relief device set over 15 PSIG and are used in a plant of any size or storage capacity must be inspected if they:

- Use over 18 tons of refrigerating capacity, **or**
- Require over 36 driving horsepower

Refrigeration systems must be inspected every year.

The inspection includes: the liquid receiver, condenser, all safety valves and their discharge points, gauges, controls, and other important parts.

## Refrigeration Systems That Do Not Need Inspection

Inspection is not required for systems using **flammable, highly toxic, or toxic refrigerants** that:

- Use 3 tons or less of refrigerating capacity, **or**
- Require 6 horsepower or less to operate

Inspection is not required for systems using **nonflammable and nontoxic refrigerants** that:

- Use 18 tons or less of refrigerating capacity
- Require 36 horsepower or less to operate, **or**

## How Inspections Work

After your refrigeration system is registered and passes the first inspection, a State inspector or your insurance company will contact you to set up future inspections.

Even though they keep track of the due dates, it’s your responsibility to make sure all required equipment gets inspected.
