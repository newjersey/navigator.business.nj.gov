summaryDescriptionMd: >-
  You must renew your underground storage tank (UST) registration once a year
  through the [NJDEP online portal](https://dep.nj.gov/online/). There are 3
  ways to renew:


  1. If you own the facility or tank, you can complete and certify the application yourself.

  2. You can fill out an [authorization form](https://dep.nj.gov/srp/forms/ust/) that lets another person complete and certify the application for you.

  3. You can have someone else complete the application for you without certifying it. Then certify the application yourself.
