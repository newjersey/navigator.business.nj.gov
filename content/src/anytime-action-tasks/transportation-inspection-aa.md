  Before purchasing a bus, **it's highly recommended to seek consultation from a transportation specialist or licensed NJ bus dealer.** This will ensure that your bus can be legally operated within the state of NJ.


  :::


  All transportation vehicles must pass an initial inspection before you register them for Omnibus (code 54) or s1/s2 plates.

## Eligibility Criteria

Before scheduling your initial inspection, make sure that:

* The bus is titled or in the process of being titled in the state of NJ
* The bus is configured for passenger service in the state of NJ, and meets federal safety standards (seating, mirrors, signage, flashing lights, etc)
* Any modifications or retrofits are completed

## How to Schedule Your Inspection

**School Buses:** Call the MVC School Bus Inspection Unit at **(609) 633-9473** to schedule an initial inspection.

**Commercial Buses:** Call the MVC Commercial Bus Inspection Unit at **(609) 777-4196** to schedule an initial inspection.

You'll be asked to provide information about the bus(es), location, and facility, particularly if you want the inspection to be performed on-site.

After passing initial inspection, **buses must continue to be inspected every 6 months.** The NJ MVC inspector assigned to your area will schedule these for you, and will reach out shortly before the scheduled inspection date as a reminder.
