  Note: this one is an informational task screen. There is no application form -- it's a bunch of documents a lawyer essentially puts together. Our SME has told us PRED developers should be familiar with the industry terms here (like title search).

## Eligibility Criteria

- Own the land where the development is located

## Application Requirements

It’s best to hire a real estate or land use attorney to handle the legal paperwork and formatting of the application. Your attorney may ask you to prepare the following documents for the application:

- A copy of the land deed or similar document that proves you own the land where the development is
- A copy of a title search report or certificate
- A legal description and survey of the land
- Copies of your `business formation documents|certificate-formation` , such as articles of incorporation
- Audited financial statements for your company and related entities
- Copies of property contracts or purchase agreements
- A statement about any litigation, orders, or judgments that might affect the properties you will market and sell
- A copy of your new home builder registration card, if applicable
