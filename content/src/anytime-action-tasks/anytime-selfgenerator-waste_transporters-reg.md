   **Keep in mind:**

  * To register, you have to get a [tax clearance certificate](/actions/tax-clearance-certificate-apply). This document shows that your business is in good standing with taxes

  * You can only get registration decals for [business vehicles registered as commercial vehicles](https://www.nj.gov/mvc/vehicles/commvehinfo.htm#39). Passenger (Pass) or passenger-commercial (Pass-Com) vehicle registrations are not acceptable

  * This registration does not allow you to transport waste for others. If you need to do that, [apply for an A-901 license](https://dep.nj.gov/dshw/swpl/a-901/)
