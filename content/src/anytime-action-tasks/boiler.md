## Boilers That Need Inspection

A steam or hot water boiler must be inspected if it meets the following condition:

* Has 10 square feet or more of heating surface

If the boiler has 1 of the following and serves a building with 6+ housing units or 25+ people, it
also requires inspection:

* 10 kilowatts of incoming power, or
* A heat output of 40,000 BTU per hour

Hot water and steam boilers are inspected in 2 parts:

* The outside is inspected every year
* The inside is inspected every 2 years (unless a steam boiler is part of a continuous processing
  operation; this requires fewer inspections)

During the inspection, a hydrostatic test (a type of pressure test) may be required to check the
structural integrity of the boiler.

## Boilers That Do Not Need Inspection

A steam or hot water boiler is exempt and does not need to be inspected if it **meets any** of the
following conditions:

* Has less than 10 square feet of heating surface
* Has less than 10 kilowatts of incoming power, or produces less than 40,000 BTU per hour of heat
  output
* Is under the control of the United States government and is regulated by a federal agency
* Is used only for motor vehicle propulsion and is regulated by the
  [Motor Vehicle Act, Title 39 of the Revised Statutes](https://www.nj.gov/mvc/about/regs.htm)

If the boiler meets any of the following and serves a building with less than 6 housing units or
less than 25 people, it also does not need inspection:

* It is a steam boiler with a relief valve set to discharge at 15 psig or lower
* It is a hot water boiler with a relief valve set to discharge at 160 PSI or lower and operates
  reliably at temperatures below or up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit

## How Inspections Work

After your boiler is registered and passes the first inspection, either a State inspector or your
insurance company will contact you to set up future inspections.

Even though they keep track of the due dates, it’s your responsibility to make sure all required
equipment gets inspected.

- If your equipment is not inspected as required, it could pose serious safety risks. You could face
  fines or legal penalties for non-compliance
- For new boilers, you may not be able to get an official `Certificate of Occupancy|` for your
  building until your inspection is passed
