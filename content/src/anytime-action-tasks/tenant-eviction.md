   Eviction is a complicated process. The information below is a general description of the process. Consult the [New Jersey Courts Landlord/Tenant website](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/landlord-tenant) for more information on how to properly file an eviction in your county.

  * Failure to pay rent by the due date and grace period specified in the lease

  * Intentional property damage

  * Significant lease violations

  * Unlawful or criminal activities

  * Permanent removal of your property from the rental market

## 1. Write a Notice to Quit

Start by writing your tenant a `Notice to Quit|notice-to-quit`. You must give this notice before filing for eviction, unless your tenant hasn’t paid rent and doesn’t live in federally subsidized housing.

The notice should include:

* Why you are ending the tenancy
* How your tenant can resolve the issue
* When they need to resolve the issue by to avoid eviction

In some cases, you may also need to give your tenant a `Notice to Cease|notice-to-cease`. For more information about the notices, review the [Truth in Renting Guide](https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/publications/pdf_lti/t_i_r.pdf).

## 2. File for Eviction

If the issue between you and your tenant is not resolved, you can file for eviction. You can file with the [Office of the Clerk of the Special Civil Part](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/directories/court-services/special-civil-part-offices-dir) in the county where your rental is located.

## 3. Go to Court

You and your tenant have a chance to settle the case before going to court. For example, if your tenant pays the full rent owed, they can avoid eviction. 

If the case goes to court and you win or your tenant doesn’t show up, you can request a warrant for removal. The warrant allows a court officer to evict the tenant. For more details about the court process, review the [New Jersey Courts' Landlord/Tenant Procedures](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12822_lt_proc_notice.pdf).
