Eviction is a complicated process. The information below is a general description of the process. Landlords and tenants should consult the [Division of Housing and Community Resources](https://nj.gov/dca//dhcr/index.shtml) or get legal help.

:::

## Write a Notice to Quit

Start by writing your tenant a `Notice to Quit|notice-to-quit`. You must give this notice before filing for eviction, unless your tenant hasn’t paid rent and doesn’t live in federally subsidized housing.

The notice should include:

* Why you are ending the tenancy
* How your tenant can resolve the issue
* The risk of eviction if your tenant doesn’t comply

In some cases, you may also need to give a `Notice to Cease|notice-to-cease`. For more information about the notices, review the [Truth in Renting Guide](https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/publications/pdf_lti/t_i_r.pdf).



## File for Eviction

If your tenant doesn’t comply with the Notice to Quit, you can file a suit for eviction. The timing and requirements may vary depending on the reason for eviction.

You can file a suit with the Office of the Clerk of the Special Civil Part in the county where your rental is.



## Go to Court

You and your tenant have a chance to settle the case before going to court. For example, if your tenant pays the full rent owed, they can avoid eviction. 

If the case goes to court and you win or your tenant doesn’t show up, you can request a warrant for removal. The warrant allows a court officer to evict the tenant. For more details about the court process, review the [Landlord/Tenant Procedures](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12822_lt_proc_notice.pdf).
