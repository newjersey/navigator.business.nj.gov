summaryDescriptionMd: >
  If you need to modify your underground storage tank (UST) registration, you
  must submit the "Modification of UST Facility Registration" application
  through the [NJDEP online portal](https://dep.nj.gov/online/). There are 3
  ways to renew:


  1. If you own the facility or tank, you can complete and certify the application yourself.

  2. You can fill out an [authorization form](https://dep.nj.gov/srp/forms/ust/) that lets another person complete and certify the application for you.

  3. You can have someone else complete the application for you without certifying it. Then certify the application yourself.


  You may need to update your registration if you are changing, for example:

  - The tank operator

  - The liquid you store in the tank

  - The facility address
