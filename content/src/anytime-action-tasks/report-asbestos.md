  If you are removing more than 3 square or linear feet of material that
  contains more than 1% asbestos, you must submit a Notification of Asbestos
  Abatement. This tells the State when and where asbestos work will happen. All
  asbestos abatement work must be done by a licensed asbestos abatement
  contractor. 


  Send this form **at least 10 days before the work begins**.  If your plans or the scope changes, such as placing the project on hold or taking it off hold, you may have to submit an updated form or payment.

* You’re working on roofing or exterior siding that contains asbestos, unless it’s for demolition
