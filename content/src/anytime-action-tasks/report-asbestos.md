  If you are removing more than 3 square or linear feet of material that
  contains more than 1% asbestos, you must submit a Notification of Asbestos
  Abatement. This tells the State when and where asbestos work will happen. All
  asbestos abatement work must be done by a licensed asbestos abatement
  contractor. 


  Send this form at least **10 days before the work begins**. If your plans or the scope changes, such as placing the project on hold or taking it off hold, you may have to submit an updated form or payment.

## Asbestos Work That Does Not Require Notification

You don’t need a Notification of Asbestos Abatement if **any** of the following are true:

* The material contains 1% or less asbestos
* You’re removing 3 feet or less of asbestos-containing material from pipes, or 3 square feet or less from ducts, boilers, tanks, or similar equipment (this may also apply to other areas like walls, ceilings, or floors, depending on the type of project)
* The work is limited repair, such as sealing with duct tape, cement, or other materials
* You’re working on roofing or exterior siding that contains asbestos, unless it’s for demolition
* You’re only selling or storing asbestos, not disturbing it
* Your company is using your own trained employees to handle asbestos at your own facility, and those employees are covered by federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules
