Having an apprenticeship program is a requirement to be a contractor. This program allows you to develop skilled employees who work to meet your business needs. You can develop the training to best suit your business.

Start the process by connecting with the New Jersey Department of Labor (NJDOL) Office of Apprenticeship. They will walk you through the registration process and your responsibilities as a program sponsor.

You will then work with a representative from the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) to develop and register your program.
