### Eligibility Criteria
* Business must be at least 51 percent owned, operated, and controlled by persons who identify as LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Transgender, Queer, Questioning+)
* Recognition of the business as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient for recognition as an LGBTQ+ business. In determining whether a potential LGBTQ+ business is an independent business, all relevant factors shall be considered, including the date the business was established and the degree to which financial, equipment leasing, and other relationships with non- LGBTQ+ businesses vary from industry practice.
* Licensing. When a professional or occupational license or certification is required by Federal or State law to perform the primary business operations of the applicant business, and the LGBTQ+ business does not possess the applicable license or certification, the LGBTQ+ owner shall demonstrate competence in the affairs of the business, in order to satisfy the requirement for managerial and operational control.

### Application Needs

* The names and addresses of members of the board of directors, in the case of corporations
