Substantial renovations (gut rehab) are defined as one of the following types of projects: (1) change of use and reconstruction of an existing building; (2) construction work of a nature requiring that the building or portion of the building within be out of service for at least 30 consecutive days; or (3) reconstruction of a vacant structure or a portion of the building within.
