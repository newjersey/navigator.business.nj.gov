summaryDescriptionMd: The Combined Heat and Power - Fuel Cells (CHP-FC) program
  aims to enhance energy efficiency through on-site power generation with
  recovery and productive use of waste heat, and to reduce existing and new
  demands to the electric power grid. The program plans to do this by providing
  generous financial incentives for Combined Heat & Power (CHP) and Fuel Cell
  (FC) installations.

## Eligibility

* CHP or Waste Heat to Power projects must achieve an annual system efficiency of at least 60% (Higher Heating Value - HHV), based on total energy input and total utilized energy output
* FC systems must achieve an annual electric system efficiency of at least 40% (HHV) based on Net Useful Electric Power plus Net Useful Thermal Production (if any) divided by the Total Fuel Input at HHV

:::callout{ showHeader="true" headerText="Benefits" showIcon="false" calloutType="conditional" }

* No more than $4.5M in new incentive commitments can be made towards ≥40% Fuel Cells during Fiscal Year 2023
* Of the $4.5M, no single prime mover manufacturer can qualify for a total of $1.5M in incentives for qualifying ≥40% Fuel Cells equipment
* Natural gas, hydrogen, biogas, and mixed fuel (such as, natural gas and biogas) CHP-FC equipment installed on the customer side of the utility meter is eligible for incentives
* 100% renewable fueled projects, including biogas and landfill gas-fueled projects which meet CHP program criteria, are also eligible to receive incentives
