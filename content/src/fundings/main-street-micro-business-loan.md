Main Street Micro Business Loan will provide financing of up to $50,000 to eligible micro businesses in New Jersey with ten or fewer full-time employees and no greater than $1M in annual revenues. The program is the successor to the Micro Business Loan Program established by the NJEDA in 2019.

* Must have a credit score of at least a 600 from at least one owner to be eligible.
* Must have no more than 10 full-time employees (All employees must work in New Jersey as evidenced by WR-30 filings. There is no minimum employee number and sole proprietors are eligible.)
* Must be legally registered to do business in New Jersey, with a business location in New Jersey
* Must be formed at least six months prior to the date of application, as evidenced by the date of formation/incorporation.
