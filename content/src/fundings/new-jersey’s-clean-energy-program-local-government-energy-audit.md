The Local Government Energy Audit (LGEA) program provides an energy audit at no cost for eligible facilities owned by municipalities, school districts, 501(c)(3) non-profits, and other local and state government entities (applicants). The goal of the energy audit is to provide applicants with information on how their facilities use energy, identify energy conservation measures that can reduce energy, put applicants in a position to implement these measures, and guide applicants towards financial incentives offered by utilities and state.

### Eligibility
The program is open to all local governments, New Jersey state colleges or state universities, county colleges, public schools, and non-profit agencies exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that are located within the service territory of at least one of the state's regulated investor-owned utilities.

>### Benefit
>The LGEA Program provides audits up to a value of $150,000 per program year, per applicant. For larger applicants, if the audit cost exceeds or is expected to exceed $150,000, there is a potential larger cost cap for applicants pursuing the Energy Savings Improvement Program and eligible healthcare entities, not to exceed $300,000.
