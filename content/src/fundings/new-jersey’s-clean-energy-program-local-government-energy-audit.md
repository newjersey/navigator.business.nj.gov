The Local Government Energy Audit (LGEA) program provides an energy audit at no cost for eligible facilities owned by municipalities, school districts, 501(c)(3) non-profits, and other local and state government entities (applicants).  The goal of the energy audit is to provide applicants with information on how their facilities use energy, identify energy conservation measures that can reduce energy, put applicants in a position to implement these measures, and guide applicants towards financial incentives offered by utilities and state.

###Eligibility
The LGEA Program is open to all local governments, New Jersey state colleges or state universities, county colleges, public schools, and non-profit agencies exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that are located within the service territory of at least one of the state's regulated investor-owned utilities are eligible.  Typical building types include but are not limited to offices, courtrooms, town halls, police/fire stations, sanitation buildings, transportation structures, schools, and community centers.

>### Benefit
>The LGEA Program provides audits up to a value of $150,000 per program year, per applicant.  For larger applicants, if the audit cost exceeds or is expected to exceed $150,000, there is a potential larger cost cap for applicants pursuing the Energy Savings Improvement Program and eligible healthcare entities, not to exceed $300,000. In order to understand how they can save energy, the LGEA Program allows local government agencies, state contracting agencies, public agencies, state colleges and state universities, and select non-profit agencies, to examine their facilities and see how they can improve their energy use.  The program can eligible entities identify cost-justified energy-efficiency measures, as well as subsidize the full cost of the audit.  The entire audit process including customer assistance, application processing and auditing.
