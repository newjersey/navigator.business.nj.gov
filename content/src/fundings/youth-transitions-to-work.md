he mission of the YTTW program is to recruit, screen and facilitate effective transitions of high school juniors, seniors and Out of School Youth (ages 16-24) to high-skill, high-wage employment in labor demand occupations. Programs funded are expected to establish YTTW programs in new apprenticeship occupations or industries, link secondary education and higher educational institutions to existing USDOL apprenticeship programs, reactivate registered programs that are not currently in use, and increase the number of high school graduates entering Registered Apprenticeship programs in NJ.
