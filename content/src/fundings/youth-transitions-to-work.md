  The mission of the Youth Transitions to Work (YTTW) program is to recruit,
  screen, and facilitate your effective transition as a high school junior,
  senior, or Out of School Youth (ages 16-24) to high-skill, high-wage
  employment in labor-demand occupations. 


  Funded programs are expected to increase the number of high school graduates entering [USDOL Registered Apprenticeship](https://www.nj.gov/labor/career-services/apprenticeship/findaprogram.shtml) programs in New Jersey by establishing YTTW programs in new apprenticeship occupations or industries, linking secondary education and higher educational institutions to [existing USDOL apprenticeship programs](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/apprenticeship), and reactivating registered programs not currently in use.
