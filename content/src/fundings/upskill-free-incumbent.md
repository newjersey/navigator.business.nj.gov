Upskill offers New Jersey employers of any size grants to improve existing employeesâ€™ skills. Training may be provided by employers at their business or by an eligible training provider. These should be cohort-based trainings, not unique to one employee.

**Benefits:** Employers can receive grants of up to $100,000.

**Eligibility:** Employers with existing employees who they want to train in a new skill for current and future workforce demands are eligible.
