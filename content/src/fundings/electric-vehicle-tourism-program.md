The EV Tourism Program is offering incentives to promote electric vehicle (“EV”) adoption and tourism through investment in EV chargers at key New Jersey tourism sites, landmarks, and other areas of interest (“Tourism Areas”) that highlight the best that New Jersey has to offer. The primary goal of the grant is to assist local businesses and municipalities in Tourism Areas by supporting the build-out of EV chargers. This initiative seeks to establish a series of EV chargers in corridor and community locations. Applicants for the EV Tourism Program that intend to own and operate EV chargers on their property in Tourism Areas will be able to apply for a grant from the EV Tourism Program.
