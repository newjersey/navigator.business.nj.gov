> **Benefits**
>
> NJ CELs can lower the cost of financing, by providing loans at 3% below the financial institution's interest rate. Minority-, Woman-, and Veteran-owned businesses receive an additional 1% interest rate reduction. Businesses/projects located in an Overburdened Community also receive a 1% interest rate reduction. (These can be combined, for a total of 5% below the financial institution's interest rate.) In addition, 10% loan forgiveness is also available for these applicants, if a certain job creation metric is met. Additional information and a map of Overburdened Communities can be found on the website.
