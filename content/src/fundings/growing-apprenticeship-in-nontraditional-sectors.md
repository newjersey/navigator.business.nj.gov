The mission of the Growing Apprenticeship in Nontraditional Sectors (GAINS) program is to promote the expansion and development of [USDOL-approved Registered Apprenticeship](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/registered-apprenticeship-program) programs. The goals of GAINS are to establish new programs, expand existing programs, and establish apprenticeship programs in occupations, sectors, or industries in New Jersey not currently registered with USDOL.

The GAINS program provides New Jersey businesses/organizations or current registered apprenticeship sponsors in targeted sectors with support for new [Registered Apprenticeship](https://www.nj.gov/labor/career-services/apprenticeship/findaprogram.shtml) program development or existing Registered Apprenticeship programs seeking to expand into new [USDOL-approved occupations](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-occupations).
