Every pass-through entity \[LJ25] that has filed an election to
pay the Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax must file Form PTE-100.

Income and losses of a pass-through entity are passed through to its members. However, pass-through entities may elect to pay a Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax due on the sum of each of the member's share of distributive proceeds. The members may then claim a refundable tax credit for the amount of tax paid by the pass-through entity on their share of distributive proceeds.

The business is required to file a [timely election form](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/ptepmtsystem.shtml), available on our website, in order to participate in (file and pay) BAIT.
