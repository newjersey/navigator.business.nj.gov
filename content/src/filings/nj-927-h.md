If you employ a household worker, you may be considered a domestic employer. Some examples of this are nannies, caretakers, housekeepers, butlers, groundskeepers, etc. The IRS can advise you if you need to withhold federal taxes for these employees. If you do, you must also withhold New Jersey taxes. Your employee can also choose to have New Jersey taxes withheld or claim they are exempt from the withholding requirement. If you determine you are a domestic employer and are required to withhold, you must file and pay annually.
