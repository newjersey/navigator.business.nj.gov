The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can advise you if you need to withhold federal taxes for these employees. If you do, you must also withhold New Jersey taxes. Your employee can also choose to have New Jersey taxes withheld or claim they are exempt withholding.

When you file and pay this tax you will be filing for and contributing to your `Unemployment Insurance|unemployment-insurance`, Temporary Disability Insurance, and `Family Leave Insurance|family-leave-insurance`.
