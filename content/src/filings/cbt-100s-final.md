Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which includes revenue minus the cost of any goods sold, general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, and other operating costs.  
 In general, all Corporation Business Tax (CBT) returns and payments, whether self-prepared or prepared by a tax professional, must be submitted electronically. This includes returns, estimated payments, extensions, and vouchers
