This tax is charged on the rental of every room in a hotel, motel, or similar facility. 

A “hotel/motel” is a building regularly used and kept open for lodging, is typically maintained by on-site management with a front desk reception, and includes services such as maid and room service.

Receipts from hotel occupancies must be reported for Sales Tax purposes. This is a separate tax from the State Occupancy Fee and Municipal Occupancy Tax and must be filed and paid separately.
