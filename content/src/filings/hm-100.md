  The current Sales Tax rate is 6.625%. (This is the sales tax rate, not the occupancy rate)

  Generally, the State Occupancy Fee is 5% of the room rental amount or value. However, in cities where such occupancies are already subject to a municipal tax, the State Occupancy Fee is imposed at a lower rate. 

  Since Newark, Jersey City, Atlantic City, Wildwood, Wildwood Crest, North Wildwood and Elizabeth City (effective July 2, 2007) already
  impose local taxes or fees on hotel/motel occupancies, the new State Occupancy Fee is imposed at a lower rate in those areas:

  Newark, Jersey City, Atlantic City, and Elizabeth City: State Occupancy Fee is 1%

  The Wildwoods: State Occupancy Fee is 3.15%

This is a fee on the rent for every occupancy of a room in a hotel motel or similar facility. A “hotel/motel” is a building that is regularly used and kept open for lodging, is typically maintained by on-site management with front desk reception, and includes services such as maid and room service.

Receipts from hotel occupancies also must be reported for Sales Tax purposes, which is separate and distinct from the State Occupancy
Fee and Municipal Occupancy Tax.

In addition to the HM-100 (for the occupancy tax,) the facility must also file the appropriate sales tax
return and report and remit the sales tax separately from the occupancy fee/tax.
