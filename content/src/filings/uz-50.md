Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) were created to stimulate economic activity in distressed areas. The State provides businesses within UEZs with tax relief incentives such as:

* The right to purchase items and most services without paying sales and use tax
* Corporation Business Tax credits for businesses hiring new employees
* Partial Sales Tax exemption to most taxable sales of tangible personal property in the UEZ.
* Unemployment insurance tax benefits
* Sales and Use Tax exemption for the purchase of natural gas and electricity used by a qualified UEZ manufacturer[](https://www.nj.gov/dca/affiliates/uez/publications/pdf/ProgramProcedures.pdf)
