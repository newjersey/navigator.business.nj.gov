Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) were created to stimulate economic activity in distressed areas. The State provides businesses within UEZs with tax relief incentives such as:

- The right to purchase items and most services without paying sales and use tax
- Corporation Business Tax credits for businesses hiring new employees
- Partial Sales Tax exemption to most taxable sales of tangible personal property in the UEZ.
- Unemployment insurance tax benefits
- Sales and Use Tax exemption for the purchase of natural gas and electricity used by a qualified UEZ manufacturer
