Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which includes revenue minus the cost of any goods sold, general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, and other operating costs.

An extension of time is granted only to file your New Jersey Corporation

Business Tax return. There is no extension of time to
pay the tax due.
