Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc.

The extension is only to file your New Jersey Corporation Business Tax return. There is no extension of time to pay the tax due.
