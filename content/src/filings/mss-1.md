This Cigarette Tax is collected from manufacturers to report taxable cigarettes sold in New Jersey.

The MSS-1 returns are for manufacturers to report shipments of unstamped cigarettes that are not being shipped to a distributor in NJ. They use this form for reporting cigarettes that are being shipped to NJ for testing such as fire safe testing. The manufacturer would pay the cigarette tax on these shipments since the cigarettes are being destroyed during the testing.
