All employers, except domestic employers, must file this form, even if there was no tax withheld. You will either file 927 or 927-w: the difference between these two forms is filing frequency.

When you file and pay this tax you will be filing for and contributing to your `Unemployment Insurance|unemployment-insurance` , Temporary Disability Insurance, and Family Leave Insurance.
