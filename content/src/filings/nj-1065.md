Partnerships involving New Jersey resident owners must file partnership returns. Income and gains derived from a partnership are taxed whether or not they are actually distributed amongst the partners.

Every partnership that has income or losses from sources in the State of New Jersey, or that has any type of New Jersey resident partner, must file this form. A partnership must file this form even if its principal place of business is outside the State of New Jersey. 

Form NJ-1065 is not solely an information return. A filing fee and tax may be imposed on the partnership.
