Partnerships with a resident owner, income, or owner with losses derived from New Jersey must file partnership returns. Income and gains derived from a partnership are taxed whether or not they are actually distributed amongst the partners.

Every partnership that has income or loss derived from sources in the State of New Jersey, or has any type of New Jersey resident partner, must file Form NJ-1065. A partnership must file even if its principal place of business is outside the State of New Jersey. The NJ-1065 is not solely an information return. A filing fee and tax may be imposed on the partnership.
