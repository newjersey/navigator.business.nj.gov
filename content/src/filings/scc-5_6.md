This is a tax imposed on owners or operators of major facilities used to refine, store, produce, handle, transfer, process, or transport hazardous substances, including petroleum products.

It's also imposed on owners of a hazardous substance which is transferred to a public storage terminal. When a hazardous substance other than petroleum, is transferred from a major New Jersey facility to a facility which is not a major facility, the transferor shall be liable for tax payment for the transfer.

This must be filed by ALL registered operators of major facilities regardless of whether tax liability has been incurred for a given month.
