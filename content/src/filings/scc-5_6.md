This is a tax imposed on owners or operators of major facilities used to refine, store, produce, handle, transfer, process, or transport hazardous substances, including petroleum products.

It's also imposed on owners of a hazardous substance transferred to a public storage terminal. When a hazardous substance other than petroleum is transferred from a major New Jersey facility to a minor facility, the transferor shall be liable for the tax payment involved with the transfer.

This must be filed by all registered operators of major facilities regardless of whether tax liability has been incurred for a given month.
