Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc. 

Businesses whose prior year's tax due was greater than $500 must make four 25% estimated tax payments in the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th month of their accounting period for the current year’s tax due.

Businesses with gross receipts of $50M or more for the prior tax period must make installment payments: 25% in the 4th month, 50% in the 6th month and 25% in the 12th month. 

Businesses whose prior year's tax due was $500 from CBT-100 or CBT-100U or $375 from CBT-100S, may make 1 estimated tax payment of 50% of the prior year’s tax due. This option is due on the same date as the previous year's tax return date.
