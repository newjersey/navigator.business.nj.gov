These are Federal forms provided to the State of New Jersey to verify health coverage and shared responsibility payment (SRP) on individual returns.

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees in the previous year use forms 1094-C and 1095-C to report information about offers of healthcare coverage and employee enrollment in healthcare coverage.

New Jersey does not require coverage providers to transmit 1094 forms, though they are accepted along with 1095 forms. New Jersey will accept form NJ-1095 from any filer.

Form 1094-C acts as a cover sheet and is sent only to the IRS.
