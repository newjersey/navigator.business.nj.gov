These are Federal forms provided to NJ for purpose of verifying health coverage and SRP on individual returns

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in the previous year use Forms 1094-C and 1095-C to report the information required under sections 6055 and 6056 about offers of health coverage and enrollment in health coverage for their employees.

New Jersey does not require coverage providers to transmit 1094 forms, though we will accept them if a coverage provider sends them as part of a larger file that includes 1095 forms. New Jersey will accept the NJ-1095 form from any filer.

1094-C acts as a cover sheet about the 1095-C and is sent only to the IRS.
