These are Federal forms provided to NJ for purpose of verifying health coverage and SRP on individual returns

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in the previous year use Forms 1094-C and 1095-C to report the information required under sections 6055 and 6056 about offers of health coverage and enrollment in health coverage for their employees.

1095-C provides information about health insurance and is sent to both employees and the IRS
