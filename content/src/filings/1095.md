These are Federal forms provided to the State of New Jersey to verify health coverage and shared responsibility payment (SRP) on individual returns.

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees in the previous year use forms 1094-C and 1095-C to report information about offers of healthcare coverage and employee enrollment in healthcare coverage.

Form 1095-C provides information about health insurance and is sent to both employees and the IRS.
