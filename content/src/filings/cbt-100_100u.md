Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc.

### Combined Return Filers

The group must have a registered `managerial member|tax-managerial-member` to make payments or file returns. Once registered, the managerial member will be assigned a Unitary ID number that must be used to submit returns and payments.

Corporations that qualify as financial businesses must file the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Return for Banking and Financial Business (form BFC-1) or the Corporation Business Tax Combined Return (form CBT-100U).

Corporations that qualify as financial businesses derive 75% of their gross income from the following financial activities:

- Discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidence of debt,
- Buying and selling exchange,
- Making of or dealing in secured or unsecured loans and discounts,
- Dealing in securities or shares of corporate stock by purchasing and selling such securities and stock solely on the order and for the account of customers,
- Investing and reinvesting in marketable obligations in the form of investment securities, or
- Dealing in or underwriting obligations of the United States, any state or any political subdivision thereof or of a corporate instrumentality of any of them
- Leasing transactions similar to secured loans because they meet each of the following requirements:
  - Lessor looks into the creditworthiness of the lessee to recover its investment
  - Lessor does not rely on repetitious leasing of the same property
  - The lease must be a net lease
  - The lessor must recover its full investment plus its cost of financing through the rental payments, tax benefits, and the residual value of the property
