Corporate Business Tax (CBT-100) is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc.

**Combined Return Filers (CBT-100u)**, the group must have a registered `managerial member|tax-managerial-member` to make payments or file returns. Once registered, the managerial member will be assigned a Unitary ID number that must be used to submit returns and payments.
