Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc.

**Combined Return Filers**, the group (filing CBT-100/100u) must have a registered `managerial member|tax-managerial-member` to make payments or file returns. Once registered, the managerial member will be assigned a Unitary ID number that must be used to submit returns and payments.

Corporations that qualify as `financial business|financial-business` must file the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Return for Banking and Financial Business (form BFC-1) or the Corporation Business Tax Combined Return (form CBT-100U).
