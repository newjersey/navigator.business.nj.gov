This tax form is collected from resident distributors (CR-1) or non-NJ resident dealers (CNR-1) to report taxable cigarettes sold in New Jersey.

This form reports the movement of the distributorâ€™s cigarette inventory and cigarette tax stamps. Resident distributors report based on unstamped cigarette inventory, and non-resident distributors report based on NJ stamped cigarette inventory.

The tax amount is collected when the cigarette stamps are purchased from the New Jersey Department of Revenue and Enterprise Services (DORES).
