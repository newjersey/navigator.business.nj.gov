This Cigarette Tax is collected primarily from resident distributors (CR-1) or non-NJ resident dealers (CNR-1) to report taxable cigarettes sold in New Jersey.

These returns report the movement of the distributorâ€™s inventory of cigarettes and cigarette tax stamps. Resident distributors report based on unstamped cigarette inventory, and non-resident distributors report based on NJ stamped cigarette inventory.

The tax is collected when the cigarette stamps are purchased from DORES
