The Cigarette Tax is collected primarily from wholesale dealers to report any sales to unlicensed cigarette retail dealers and purchases from wholesale dealers.

The sale of cigarettes to unlicensed businesses is prohibited, so this form reports any wholesalerâ€™s customers that have not renewed their cigarette license for the current year (licenses expire on March 31st each year). It also reports your sales, in number of sticks (cigarettes) and revenue sales.

The tax amount is collected when the cigarette stamps are purchased from the New Jersey Department of Revenue and Enterprise Services (DORES).
