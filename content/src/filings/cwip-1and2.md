The Cigarette Tax is collected primarily from wholesale dealers to report sales to unlicensed cigarette retail dealers and purchases from wholesale dealers.

The sale of cigarettes to unlicensed businesses is prohibited, so this form reports a wholesalerâ€™s customers that have not renewed their cigarette license for the current year (licenses expire on 3/31 each year). It also reports their sales, in number of sticks (cigarettes) and $ sales. The tax is collected when the distributors purchase the stamps from DORES. The CWIP-2 reports the purchases of cigarettes that the wholesalers purchased from the distributors.
