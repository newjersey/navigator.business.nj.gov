This Cigarette Tax is collected from distributors to report taxable cigarettes sold in New Jersey includes to unlicensed cigarette dealers and unlicensed or licensed wholesalers.

The Cigarette Tax is collected when DORES sell cigarette tax stamps to a distributor for $2.70 per stamp. Each stamp is applied to one pack of cigarettes. The Cigarette Tax returns are basically informational tax returns concerning the movement of the cigarettes from distributor to wholesaler or retailer, and the application of the stamps to the packs of cigarettes. There is no money involved with these tax returns since they are informational returns.

The sale of cigarettes to unlicensed businesses is prohibited, so this form reports a distributorâ€™s customers that have not renewed their cigarette license for the current year (licenses expire on 3/31 each year). It also reports their sales, in number of sticks (cigarettes) and $ sales. The tax is collected when the distributors purchase the stamps from DORES. The CDIS-2 reports the sales of stamped cigarettes that a distributor sold to wholesalers.
