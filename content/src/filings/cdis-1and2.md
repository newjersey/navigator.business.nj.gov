This tax is collected from distributors who report taxable cigarettes sold in New Jersey and includes sales to unlicensed cigarette dealers and licensed or unlicensed wholesalers. The Cigarette Tax is collected when the New Jersey Department of Revenue and Enterprise Services (DORES) sells cigarette tax stamps to a distributor for each cigarette box stamp. 

The Cigarette Tax return forms are informational tax returns documenting the movement of the cigarettes from distributor to wholesaler or retailer, and the application of the stamps to the packs of cigarettes. There is no money involved with these tax returns.

The sale of cigarettes to unlicensed businesses is prohibited, so this form reports a distributorâ€™s customers that have not renewed their cigarette license for the current year (licenses expire on 3/31 each year). It also reports their sales, in number of sticks (cigarettes) and revenue sales.
