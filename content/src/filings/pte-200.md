Every pass-through entity that has filed an election to
pay the Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax. Income and losses of a pass-through entity are passed through to its members. However, pass-through entities may elect to pay a Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax due on the sum of each of the member's share of distributive proceeds. The members may then claim a refundable tax credit for the amount of tax paid by the pass-through entity on their share of distributive proceeds.

This form provides a six month extension to File Form PTE-100. There is no extension of time to pay tax due.

A six-month extension of time to file your PTE-100 may be granted if at least 80% of the total tax reported on your PTE-100 when filed is paid by the original due date. Taxpayers will be notified only if the extension is denied, but not until after the PTE-100 is actually filed.

Penalties and interest are imposed whenever tax is paid after the original due date.
