Income and losses of a pass-through entity are passed through to its members. Pass-through entities may elect to pay a Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax on the sum of each of the member's proceeds. The members may then claim a tax credit for the amount of tax paid by the pass-through entity on their share of proceeds.

This form provides a six month extension to file form PTE-100. There is no extension of time to pay tax due.

A six-month extension of time to file your PTE-100 may be granted if at least 80% of the total tax reported on your PTE-100 when filed is paid by the original due date. Taxpayers will be notified only if the extension is denied, but not until after the PTE-100 is actually filed.

Penalties and interest are imposed whenever tax is paid after the original due date.
