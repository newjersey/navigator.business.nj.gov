This is a tax on businesses that have elected a form of partnership (i.e. limited liability partnership) as their legal structure. Income and gains derived from a partnership are taxed whether or not they are actually distributed among the partners.

This form provides an extension of up to five months to file form NJ-1065.

To be eligible for an extension, you must have paid at least 80% of the amount due by the original due date of your return, either through an installment payment or a payment made with this form. If the 80% requirement is not met or you do not file form NJ-1065 by the extended due date, the extension will be denied.

Penalty and interest charges will be imposed from the original due date of the return.
