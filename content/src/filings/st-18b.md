This form is for businesses that weren’t required to collect New Jersey Sales Tax from customers, but that may have Use Tax obligations that must be reported.

You are required to complete form ST-18B if your business didn’t sell taxable goods or services or lease taxable property to others during the tax year, or averaged less than $2,000 in Use Tax liability in the last three years and owes Use Tax for the current year.
