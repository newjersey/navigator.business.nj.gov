The Tourism Improvement and Development District Act authorizes municipalities in Cape May to require certain businesses to collect an additional sales tax on predominantly tourism-related retail sales. 

Tourism-related sales include admission charges to amusements, cover charges in nightclubs and cabarets, hotel or motel room occupancies and other transient accommodation rentals (e.g., vacation rentals, houses, rooms, or similar lodging used on a transient basis),and prepared food and beverages sold in restaurants, or similar establishments or by caterers.
