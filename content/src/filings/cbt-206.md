This is a tax on businesses that have elected a form of partnership (i.e. limited liability partnership) as their legal structure. Income and gains obtained from a partnership are taxed whether or not they are actually distributed amongst the partners.

This form provides an extension of up to 5 months to file form NJ-CBT-1065.

To be eligible for an extension, you must have paid at least 90% of any taxes due by the original due date, either through a tiered partnership payment, estimated payments, or a payment made with this form. 

If the 90% payment requirement is not met, or you do not file the NJ-CBT-1065 by the extended due date, the extension will be denied. Penalty and interest charges will be imposed starting on the original due date of the return.
