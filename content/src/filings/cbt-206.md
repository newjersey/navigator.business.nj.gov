This is a tax on businesses that have elected a form of partnership (i.e. limited liability partnership) as their legal structure. Income and gains derived from a partnership are taxed whether or not they are actually distributed amongst the partners.

This form provides an up to 5 Month Extension to file Form NJ-CBT-1065.

To be eligible for an extension, you must have paid by the original due date of your return, either through a tiered partnership payment, estimated payments, or a payment made with this form, at least 90% of the tax reported on the NJ-CBT-1065 when filed. If the 90% requirement is not met, or you do not file the NJ-CBT-1065 by the extended due date, the extension will be
denied. Penalty and interest charges will be imposed from the original due date of the return.
