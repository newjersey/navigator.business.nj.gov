Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which includes revenue minus the cost of any goods sold, general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, and other operating costs.

State in the traditional franchise tax sense, but, is deriving income from sources within this State; or is engaged in any type of activity or interrelationships within this State.
