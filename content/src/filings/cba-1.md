Corporate Business Tax is imposed on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which is the revenue minus the cost of any goods sold and operating costs like general and administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, research and development, depreciation, etc.

This form is only for foreign corporations that don't have a `certificate of authority|certificate-formation` to do business in New Jersey in a traditional sense, and only obtain income from sources within this State or are engaged in business activities with relationships inside this State.
