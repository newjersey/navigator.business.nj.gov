  Annually, Returns are due on April 15th day every year.
  Any short period return must be filed by the due date of the federal Form 1065. The partnership should use the most current form available from the Division of Taxation[LJ22] .

  Non-resident partners must file quarterly tax payments on the 15th of the 4th, 6th and 9th month of the tax year. (This is not always necessarily true and is really for their GIT obligations. If they have most of their tax paid by the partnership via non-res part payments or BAIT payments, they won’t need to do this. It’s not really relevant to this form)

  Partnerships may be required to

  The installment payments will be credited to the accounts of the nonresident partners in proportion to their share of ownership.
