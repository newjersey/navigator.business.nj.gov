There is no fee for requesting a certificate through the portal. You are usually only permitted to apply with a [paper application](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/pdf/busasstTaxClear.pdf) if your business is 1 of the following: trusts, banking institutions, insurance companies, individuals, and local governments such as school districts and counties. Most others are required to apply online.
