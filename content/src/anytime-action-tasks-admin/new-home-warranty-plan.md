If you are a registered new home builder who builds or sells new homes in New Jersey, or both, you must enroll each home in a `warranty plan|new-home-warranty-plan`. To enroll in and provide the warranty, you must be the person(s) or entity that owns the new home and sells it to the initial purchasers. New homes include single-family houses, duplexes, townhouses, cooperatives, condominiums, factory-built, and modular residences. The warranty plan can be the State warranty plan or an [approved private warranty plan](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/offices/nhw_war_plans.html).

To enroll a new home in a State warranty plan, complete the requirements below. To enroll in an approved private warranty plan, contact the plan representative.
