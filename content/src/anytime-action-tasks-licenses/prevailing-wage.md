If you want to work on New Jersey public works contracts, you must register with the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance within the New Jersey Department of Labor (NJDOL) per the Public Works Contractor Registration Act.

Per the [NJ State Prevailing Wage Act](https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/tools-resources/laws/prevailingwageact.shtml), the NJ DOL determines the `prevailing wage|prevailing-wage` on `public works|public-works` projects.

You must submit certified payroll records for each employee within 10 days of the payment of wages. You can either submit the [MW-562](<https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/assets/PDFs/wagehub/MW-562%20(6-23)%20PayrollCert-PublicWorks.pdf>) form, or submit online via the [NJ Wage](https://njwages.nj.gov/) Hub. Effective August 15, 2024, certified payroll records will only be accepted online.

Also, you must maintain the following records for a 2-year period from the date of payment:

- Employee information, such as Social Security number (SSN) and job trade
- Rates of pay

  - Hourly
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Overtime

- Itemized deductions
