  You must get a title showing business ownership of any vehicles used for
  business purposes.


  &nbsp;


  Typically, if you purchase a new vehicle from a New Jersey dealer, you will get a title as part of the sales process. If you opt out of this, you as the buyer are responsible for completing this process **within 10 days of the vehicle's purchase.**


  &nbsp;


  You also need to apply for a title if your vehicle:


  * Has a title from a state outside of New Jersey

  * Has a title owned by anyone other than the present business owner

  * Is owned by a lien that must be added or removed from the title

  * Does not have a title (this is rare)

  * Is a boat or watercraft (vessel), longer than twelve feet, that is owned by someone other than the intended business owner
