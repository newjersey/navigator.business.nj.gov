  A Motor Vehicle Commission 

  (MVC) Entity Identification Number (EIN) is requiring before applying for or changing a vehicle title.

  :::


  You may need a title showing business ownership of any vehicles you plan to use for business purposes.


  &nbsp;


  Typically, if you purchase a new vehicle from a New Jersey dealer, you will get a title as part of the sales process. If you opt out of this, you as the buyer are responsible for completing this process **within 10 days of the vehicle's purchase.**


  &nbsp;


  You also need to apply for a title if your vehicle:


  * Has a title from a state outside of New Jersey

  * Has a title owned by anyone other than the present business owner

  * Has a title including a lien you want removed, or if you want to add a lien to the title

  * Does not have a title (this is rare)

  * Is a boat or watercraft (vessel), longer than twelve feet, that is owned by someone other than the intended business owner
