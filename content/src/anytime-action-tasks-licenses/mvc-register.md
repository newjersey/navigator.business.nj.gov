  A Motor Vehicle Commission

  (MVC) Entity Identification Number (EIN) and title showing business ownership are required before registering a business vehicle.

  :::


  Your business vehicles must have a valid license plate and registration card to be legally driven on public roads. This includes:


  * Trucks, vans, or other vehicles that exceed a certain weight limit (usually over 10,000 pounds)

  * Vehicles used to carry freight

  * Vehicles used to carry passengers, such as taxis, limousines, and buses


  Typically,  when you purchase a new vehicle from a New Jersey dealer, **they register it for you as part of the sales process.** If you opt out, or have a vehicle that was registered out of state, you, as the buyer, are responsible for registering it in NJ.
