## MDRR Annual Report Requirements

:::infoAlert 
 Download and review the [MDRR Frequently Asked Questions document (PDF)](https://www.njoag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MDRR-FAQs.pdf) before you complete and file your annual report.
:::

The information on the annual report helps ensure equal housing opportunities. You need to submit information such as:

* Unit breakdown (number of units, rental rates, and utilities included)
* Race and ethnicity of your tenants and apartment applicants
* Number of apartment rental turnovers
* Number of Section 8 units
* Advertising and recruiting techniques
* Whether the apartment is subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or another government agency
* Whether the apartment is accessible to people with disabilities

Use the [MDRR Tenant/Applicant Inquiry Form](https://www.njoag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tenant_applic_inquiry_form.pdf) to collect and record race and ethnicity data for the annual report only. It's illegal to ask for or record a tenant's or applicant's religion, gender, sexual orientation, or citizenship status.
