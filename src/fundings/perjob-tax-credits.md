The Emerge Program provides per-job tax credits to projects in targeted communities that invest private capital into New Jersey and create new full-time jobs or retain a significant number of jobs in Governor Phil Murphy’s priority sectors versus an out-of-state alternative location.

**Benefits:** Annual base per-new job tax credits from $500,000 - $8,000 per job per year depending on project location and other aspects of the project. Bonuses are also available on project location, industry, and alignment with other policy objectives. Jobs that are covered by a labor harmony agreement are eligible for an additional $1,000 bonus over the capped amounts.

**Eligibility:** Companies that meet the program minimums for new job creation or retained jobs, are located in an eligible incentive location, and can demonstrate the award of tax credits is a “material factor” in their decision to locate in New Jersey versus an out of state alternative location.
