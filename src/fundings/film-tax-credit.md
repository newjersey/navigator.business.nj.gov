The Film Tax Credit Program provides a transferable credit against the corporation business tax and the gross income tax to incentivize production companies to film content in New Jersey.

**Benefits:** Tax credits up to 35% of qualified film production expenses.

**Eligibility:** Feature films, television series, or television shows of 22 minutes or more in length, intended for a national or regional audience that incur 60% or more of the total film production expenses for services and goods purchased through vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey.

**Not Eligible:** Productions featuring news, current events, weather, and market reports or public programming, talk show, sports event, or reality show; productions that solicit funds; productions containing obscene material as defined under N.J.S.2C:34-2 and N.J.S.2C:34-3; or productions primarily for private, industrial, corporate, or institutional purposes.
