### Site Considerations
1. **Site Drawings:** Hire an architect to create site drawings that meet your business needs and budget.
2. **Utilities:** Work with your local government on any utility or water approvals you may need.
3. **Construction Permits:** File for a construction permit with your local government's Building/Construction Department.
4. **Contractors:** Hire any contractors you may need, such as plumbers, electricians, and fire prevention, HVAC or general contractors. Industry best practice is to get 3 quotes before deciding on a contractor.

Once you have all the necessary drawings, approvals, and contractors in place, you are in a good position to get your construction or renovation started!
