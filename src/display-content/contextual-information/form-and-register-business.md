### Form and Register Your Business

All businesses need to form and register with the State of New Jersey to legally operate in the State. 

If you've fully [registered your business](https://business.nj.gov/pages/register-your-business) you should have:

- `EIN|EIN` 
- `Entity ID|entity-id` (Only required for LLC, C corp, LP and LLP)
- `NJ Tax ID|tax-id`

If you do not have all the items above, don't worry, we can help. Select "No, I still need to register my business."
