## Demographics

If you've developed your business plan, you should have a good sense of who your target customers are, who is the most likely to purchase your products or services, and who you want to market to. Use this information to your advantage and consider how you can locate your business to most effectively serve your target customer base.

Consider factors such as age, ethnicity, gender, income, buying habits, occupations, and household composition. For instance, if your target customers are mothers with small children, you may want to think about neighborhoods that are family-friendly or areas that are located close to other family amenities.
