### Entity of Interest

An Entity of Interest is any entity involved in the financing, operations, or management of an applicant or license-holder. This can include owners, management services contractors, financial sources, and may include Vendor-Contractors, but does not include passive investors.

A Vendor-Contractor is an Entity of Interest if the Vendor-Contractor is involved with the fundamental operations of the proposed cannabis business, including but not limited to the cultivation, manufacturing, retailing, storage, or transport of cannabis items and has access to or is required to possess cannabis or cannabis items.
