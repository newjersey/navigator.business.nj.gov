## Location Contract

A location contract is a written, signed agreement between you and the owner of the property where youâ€™ll park your food truck.

You will need to identify the owner of the property where you are interested in parking for a location contract to use that space for your business. Some locations or events may have a bidding process. This is true for both private and public spaces.
