The New Jersey Board of Massage and Bodywork Therapy has specific insurance requirements for your business:

**1. Professional Liability Insurance:** In order to complete your business registration, you must provide proof of professional liability insurance coverage in a minimum amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $3,000,000.00 aggregate per policy year. 

**2. Workers' Compensation Insurance:** If you plan to have employees, the State of New Jersey requires that you obtain `workers' comp insurance|workers-comp.`

To find an insurance broker, speak to your network, or local Chamber of Commerce. Oftentimes, the best way to find a broker is through word of mouth.

After you complete this task, you will have:

* A Professional Liability insurance policy for your business
* A Worker's Compensation insurance policy (if applicable)
