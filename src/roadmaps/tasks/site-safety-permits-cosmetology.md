It's time to obtain approvals that show that your site is safe for customers and workers. The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs requires you to obtain and show a fire permit and `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` prior to applying for a shop license. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.

1. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Obtain any fire prevention or burglar alarm permits from your local Fire Department. **_This is required by the Division of Consumer Affairs to receive a shop license._**
2. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you've completed site construction/renovations, it's time to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy or Approval from your local Buildings/Construction Department. **_Remember, to apply for your shop license, you will need to submit this Certificate to the Division of Consumer Affairs._**

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A fire prevention permit
- A Certificate of Occupancy or Approval
