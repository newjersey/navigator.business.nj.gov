It's time to obtain your liquor license and mercantile license. A mercantile license helps your local government track businesses in the area. Not all cities and towns require a mercantile license, you will want to check your local ordinance or contact your local clerk's office. Below is a list of items to work with your local clerk's office on.

You can find your city or town clerk through either the [${municipality} website](${municipalityWebsite}) or by contacting your [county clerk](${countyClerkWebsite}) (which is different from your city/town clerk) at ${countyClerkPhone}.

1. **Liquor License:** Obtain your liquor license.
2. **Mercantile License:** Obtain your mercantile license as required by your local government.

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A liquor license
- A mercantile license
