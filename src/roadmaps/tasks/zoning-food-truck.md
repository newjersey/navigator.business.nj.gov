Your local government may have zoning requirements. Check with the Zoning Office about the location(s) where youâ€™re interested in parking your food truck for sale of goods and services, as well as, where you plan to park the vehicle for overnight storage. You will need to do this for every location where you intend to operate your business.

**Before parking a truck in a residential neighborhood, be sure to check with your local government's zoning officer**

After you complete this task (if applicable), you will have:

- Zoning approval
