It's time to have your local government verify that your site is safe for customers and workers. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.

1. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Obtain any fire prevention or burglar alarm permits from your local Fire Department.
2. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you've completed site renovations, it's time to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` from your local Building/Construction Department.

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A fire prevention permit
- A Certificate of Occupancy or Approval
