Now that you have a site for your business, you need to ensure that your site complies with local requirements.

The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs requires you to obtain and show a fire permit and `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` prior to applying for a shop license. You will need to obtain the fire permit and Certificate from your local government. To prevent any unexpected delays, speak to your local government now to understand their expectations and timeline for review and approval. Below are additional information and permits to consider obtaining:

1. **Fire Prevention Permits:** Talk to your Fire Department to make sure your space meets requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers, and signage. **_This is required by the Division of Consumer Affairs to receive a shop license._**
2. **Store Signage:** Speak to your local Zoning Office and Building/Construction Department to make sure the signage you're proposing is permitted.
3. **Construction Permits:** Check if you need a building/construction permit with your local government's Building/Construction Department before starting any renovations. Find out the [requirements for a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections) at your site.
4. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you need a construction permit for your renovation, you may need to meet with the Building/Construction Department to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` that indicates that your space is safe for occupancy. **_This is required by the Division of Consumer Affairs to receive a shop license._**

After you complete this task, you will know:

- What permits your local government requires
- What you need to do to meet those requirements
- How long it will take to get any permits or certificates
