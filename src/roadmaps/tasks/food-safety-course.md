While not all restaurants are required to do so, many restaurants serving raw food and other delicate items must complete Food Safety Manager Certification training. Speak with you local government's Department of Health to determine if this Certificate is required. You can find [Food Safety Manager training programs](https://www.state.nj.us/health/ceohs/documents/food-drug-safety/fmc_reminder_letter.pdf) on the State of New Jersey's webpage.

After you complete this task, you will have:
