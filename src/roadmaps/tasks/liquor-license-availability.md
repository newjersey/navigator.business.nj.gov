Once you've found a site for your business, contact your local clerk's office to verify the cost and availability of a liquor license in your area. Every local government has a unique process and cost associated with obtaining a liquor license. Read the [Alcoholic Beverage Control Handbook (ABC)](https://www.nj.gov/oag/abc/downloads/abchandbook02.pdf) to ensure you're meeting all their requirements.

After you complete this task, you will have:

- A site and restaurant policies that meet the requirements in the ABC Handbook
- An understanding of the availability, cost, and timeline required to obtain a liquor license
