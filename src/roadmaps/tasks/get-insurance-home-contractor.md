As a home improvement contractor, the State requires that you have insurance for your business. To complete your registration with the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs, you must show a certificate of insurance with a commercial general liability policy with a minimum amount of $500,000 per occurrence.

To find an insurance broker, speak to your network, local Chamber of Commerce, or supplier. Oftentimes, the best way to find a broker is through word of mouth.
