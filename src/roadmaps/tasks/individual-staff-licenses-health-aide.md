Your staff will need individual home health aide licenses. The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs' Board of Nursing [maintains standards for home health aide education and training programs](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/Pages/default.aspx), and keeps a registry of all individuals who have successfully completed them.

All applicants who wish to become a Certified Homemaker-Home Health Aide (CHHA) must apply online for initial certification with the Board of Nursing and pass a criminal background check prior to beginning employment as a CHHA.

After completing this task, you will have:

- Your individual license
- Confirmed your staff is properly licensed
