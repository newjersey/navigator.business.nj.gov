## Architecture

Everything is written in **TypeScript** and runs on **Node.js**.

The frontend is **React** via **Next.js** and deployed in **Docker containers** on an **AWS Elastic
Container Service** cluster.

The backend is an **Express** app deployed as an **AWS Lambda** function using **AWS Cloud Development Kit**. It connects to an **AWS DynamoDB** instance that is also configured through
**Terraform**.

The app uses **AWS Cognito** (through **AWS Amplify**) to handle authentication for registered
users. Unregistered users are able to browse the site in guest mode without saving their data to the
DynamoDB database.

We deploy using
**[CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/newjersey/navigator.business.nj.gov)** for
CI/CD.

## Development

You will need Node.js (with Yarn installed via `npm` or `corepack`) installed for primary
development. Additionally, for running the server in local development mode, you will need a Java
runtime (DynamoDB Local and other dependencies now run inside Docker containers) and Python (for the AWS CLI and some of our scripts) installed
(details below).

We recommend using WSL2 if developing on Windows.

For pair programming, we recommend Visual Studio Code with the Live Share extension.

### Software requirements

- [Node.js 22 "Jod" LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (We recommend using
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme) for managing Node.js versions. If installing via
  package manager, we suggest installing `corepack` if available separately.)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [JRE/JDK 17.x or newer](https://jdk.java.net/)
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

**Windows (non-WSL) only**:

- [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools)
  using "Visual C++ build tools" workload

### Pre-flight

You will then setup your AWS credentials:

```shell
aws configure
```

Clone the code and navigate to the root of this repository. There is an installation script that will
install all `yarn` packages for both the frontend and backend. It also sets up the local DynamoDB.

```shell
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Local env

Before you can run locally, you will need to:

- create a `./web/.env` that includes all the values laid out in the `./web/.env-template` file.
- create a `./api/.env` that includes all the values laid out in the `./api/.env-template` file.
- create a `.venv` virtual environment and install requirements if working on Python
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- do an initial build
  ```shell
  yarn build
  ```

### Run tests

We use Jest for our TypeScript-based unit tests across our projects.

```shell
# Run all unit tests
yarn test

# Run a single unit test or file, rerunning if files change
yarn test <path to test file> -t "<part of test name>" --watch
```

We use Cypress for end-to-end (e2e) testing. You can run these tests locally as follows. Since some
Cypress tests only run in the CI environment, they require running a local instance of the
application to test against.

```shell
./scripts/local-feature-tests.sh
```

Both unit and Cypress tests utilize random values in test setup. Should a test fail, the random
values used can be reproduced by finding the log output line containing
`RANDOM_SEED=`/`CYPRESS_RANDOM_SEED=` for the test that failed. Then, run the test with the
indicated environment variable, as in:

```shell
RANDOM_SEED=<random seed from failure log> yarn test <path to test file> -t "<part of test name>"
CYPRESS_RANDOM_SEED=<random seed from failure log> ./scripts/local-feature-tests.sh
```

To run all tests with code coverage:

```shell
yarn test:coverage
```

We use Python's `unittest` for our Python tests. Run all Python unit tests with:

```shell
yarn test:python
```

### Running locally

Start the services:

```shell
yarn start:dev
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get an error from serverless that looks like `Inaccessible host: localhost at port 8000`,
this is likely a permissions' error. To solve, grant the `./api/.dynamodb` folder write permissions
on your machine.

### Deploying

Use `ship-it` to run prettier, linting, and tests before pushing:

```shell
./scripts/ship-it.sh
```

The CircleCI CI/CD (which is configured in `.circleci/config.yml`) will pick up the job and deploy
to the development environment for commits to the main branch.

## Frontend deep-dive

The frontend code lives in `./web`.

When running locally, the `./scripts/start-web.sh` will execute `npm run dev` for local
hot-refreshing of Next.js. In production, we run `npm run build` which will execute `next build` and
`next export`. This allows Next.js to build all our pages and pre-render what it can. The export
puts the final files in `./web/out` directory, which is served via a Docker Container.

### Styles

We depend on the compiled version of [NJ Web Design Standards](https://github.com/newjersey/njwds),
which is included via `npm` and then imports these styles into our code (which is configured via a
line in `_app.tsx`).

### Environment variables

For Next.js, environment variables are inserted at build time. In `./web/next.config.js`, the
environment variables that the code will have access to are set up for the Next.js framework by
pulling them in from the `.env` file. This works because the system that is building the Next.js
code (via CircleCI workflow) has access to these variables via environment variables set during that
build step.

**Important**: This means that any time you build the app, the system building it (your local
terminal, for example) needs to have these environment variables set as well, or else they will not
get set for the build app.

For Jest testing, the value that will be used for the environment variables is set in
`./web/setupTests.js`.

For running (and testing) the app locally in development mode, it needs environment variables
locally as well. These should be provided via a `./web/.env` file which should _never_ be checked
into source control. There exists a file `./web/.env-template` which provides a blank template to
show what variables should be included. This _is_ checked into source control and should be updated
any time new frontend variables are added.

### Roadmaps

In the `./content/src/roadmaps` directory, we have JSON files containing the static content defining
tasks and steps for different roadmaps. Each industry has its own roadmap definition, located in
`./content/src/roadmaps/industries`.

### Authentication

Amazon Cognito has a way of tightly coupling itself to code dependencies, which is not great. It's
somewhat isolated right now:

- `/signin` page uses the AWS Cognito components to render a sign-in page.
- `AuthButton` makes use of Cognito's sign-out feature
- `sessionHelper' is a wrapper around most Cognito Auth features.

For the rest of the app, we use our domain representation of authentication to abstract Cognito away
from this:

- `AuthContext` provides the current user state to any component that requires it, and is the
  canonical representation of whether the app is signed-in or signed-out.
- `signinHelper` is an abstraction of the business logic for what happens when a user signs in
  (redirects, etc) and should be triggered after auth actions regardless of authentication provider.

We also configure Cognito authentication programmatically in the Cypress `loginByCognitoApi`
command.

### useSWR

We use the [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) hook for handling userData fetching from the API. This
is nice because it has a built-in caching and revalidating system that fetches data when it needs
to, and serves cached data when we don't need new data. It acts as a form of state management for
React, and any component that needs to access or update the `userData` state from storage should
make use of the `useUserData` wrapper around this hook.

## Backend deep-dive

The backend code lives in `./api`. It uses [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) for
handling the integration with AWS Lambdas.

We use CDK to deploy the backend app. If you deploy from your local machine,
your AWS CLI must be configured with valid AWS credentials.

The backend app itself is defined in `src/functions/migrate.ts` and is mostly a regular Express app,
except it wraps its export in `serverless-http` to become a handler. Locally, the Express app runs normally.
API gateway routing is configured using AWS CDK in the  `/api/cdk/lib/api-stack.ts`  file, which
defines the config structure that proxies all routes through to be handled by the Express routing
system.

The rest of the code is regular hexagonal Express structure. The `src/api` folder contains route
definitions and depends on abstractions and types defined in `src/domain`. The `src/db` folder
contains the DynamoDB-specific logical implementation of the interfaces in the domain. The top-level
Express app is responsible for wiring the DynamoDB implementation into the router or anything that
has a database dependency. We use [jest-dynalite](https://github.com/freshollie/jest-dynalite) as a
testing helper to mock out DynamoDB for testing.

### Database schema and migrations

DynamoDB isn't strongly schema'd, but we do expect objects of a certain structure to be returned to
the frontend when we request user data. Sometimes we'll be changing the data structure and we need
the database to be able to account for and understand this.

We solve this by using **document versioning** and running **migrations** on individual documents as
we retrieve them from storage. The documents are stored with a schema version number (which is
stripped before sending to the frontend). On a `GET` request for a document, if its version is
out-of-date with the most recent, we run a series of migrations on it to map the data to the current
structure. We then save that new document in the current version, and return it to the frontend.

Reasons for this approach:

- zero-downtime for the database anytime we change document schema
- managed only in code, no need to handle AWS lambdas and streams to make a migration happen

Notes about this approach:

- in the database itself, various documents will be structured differently, as they will only be
  migrated when they are accessed. This isn't a concern if the documents are only ever accessed
  through the DB client layer, which performs the migrations as it accesses them

#### Adding a new migration

If you want to change the structure of the `UserData` object, there is a helper script that creates
and updates most of the relevant code at `./scripts/generate-new-migration.sh`. It takes the
following actions:

1. **Creates a new file** in `./api/src/db/migrations` and names it
   `v{X}_{migration_description}.ts` where `{X}` is replaced by the next successive version and
   `{migration_description}` is a snake-cased name describing the data being changed in the
   migration. The`{migration_description}` is prompted by the script and input by the user when
   running `generate-new-migration.sh`.

2. **Creates a new type** in the file and names it `v{X}UserData`, which defines the new structure
   of your new `UserData` type.

3. **Creates a migration function** in the file with type signature
   `(v{X-1}UserData) => v{X}UserData`, which defines the way that the previous version of the object
   should be mapped to the new structure.

   - **Note:** `generate-new-migration.sh` currently only copies the previous migration function.
     _You must write your own updated migration function_. You should also test it to verify
     transformations are executed properly.

4. **Adds the migration function to the list** of functions in
   `./api/src/db/migrations/migrations.ts`. This array should be ordered by ascending version
   number.

5. **Changes the types** in `types.ts` for `UserData` (and `factories` and anywhere else needed) to
   reflect the newest version of the type to the rest of the code.
