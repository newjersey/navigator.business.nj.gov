### S-Corporation

An S-Corporation (S-Corp) is similar to a C-Corporation except that the business is not taxed separately from the owners. S-Corps are also very similar to Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), but with more limitations. The owners, called shareholders, avoid the double taxation of a C-Corp, but the business is limited to 100 shareholders and has only one class of stock.‚Äç
