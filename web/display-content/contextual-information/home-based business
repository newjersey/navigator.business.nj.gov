## Home-based Business

A home-based business operates from your home and does not have a brick and mortar presence anywhere else. Not all businesses can be a home-based business, check with your local government Zoning Office.

Selecting this option will inform you of any permits/licenses you may need to open your business and will not impact funding opportunities.
