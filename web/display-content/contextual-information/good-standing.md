## Certificate of Good Standing

This document certifies that you are properly registered with the state and are able to operate as a business. It does NOT indicate that you are in good standing with your taxes; that document is called a Tax Clearance Certificate. Although a Certificate of Good Standing is not required to run your business, you'll need it to apply for financial resources, or to do business in another state. 

Important: A Certificate of Good Standing is only available upon request and only through the New Jersey Division of Revenue.
