## Spray Paint Booth Permit Termination

Your Spray Paint Booth may not need a permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection if:
1. Your coating application will never exceed ½ a gallon per hour, and 
2. Your spray booth will not contain a heating device with a rating of 1,000,000 BTU/hr or greater.
 
If you meet these requirements, you may [submit an application](https://www.nj.gov/dep/enforcement/docs/autobody-exemption-form-08162016.pdf) to waive the need for a paint spray booth permit.
