## Tenant Improvements

Few spaces are "turnkey ready" for your business – most businesses will require some changes and customization to help them realize their vision. Depending on the space and the market, you may be able to negotiate Tenant Improvements (or "TIs") with your landlord. Tenant Improvements can take the form of an allowance to help make improvements to the space, free rent, or the landlord may agree to make the changes themselves.
