**Renovation/ Construction and Building Permits**: A Certificate of Occupancy is required by most townships. The certificate is issued after a local inspection to ensure the building meets the requirements for the business you intend to operate. If you plan to do construction, or change the use of your building, you may need a construction permit as well. Some municipalities may require a fire permit and burglar alarm system. Check with your local Building Department.
