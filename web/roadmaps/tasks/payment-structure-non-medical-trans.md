As a non-medical transport company, you may want to consider one or a combination of the following payment structures:

1. Accept payment directly from your customer
2. Bill `Medicaid|medicaid`
   - **Contract with `Logisticare|logisticare`** (they will bill Medicaid for your transport services)
   - **Contractor with a medical care facility** like a nursing home (they may bill Medicaid for your services)
