Now that you signed your lease, it's time to obtain permits that allow you to build or renovate your site. 

If you are planning to renovate your site, this task may apply to you. Consider completing the following activities before starting any renovation or construction:
      
1. **Site Drawings:** Hire an architect to create site drawings that meet your business needs and budget.
2. **Utilities:** Work with your local government on any utility or water approvals you may need.
3. **Construction Permits:** File for a construction permit with your local government's Building/Construction Department.
4. **Contractors:** Hire any contractors you may need, such as plumbers, electricans, and fire prevention, HVAC or general contractors. Industry best practice is to get 3 quotes before deciding on a contractor.

Once you have all the necessary drawings, approvals, and contractors in place, you are in a good position to get your construction or renovation started!
 
After you complete this task (if applicable), you will have:
- Site drawings
- Utility approvals
- Consutrction permits
- Contractors for build out
