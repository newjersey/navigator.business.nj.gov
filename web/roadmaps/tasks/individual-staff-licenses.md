You and/or your staff will need to have individual cosmetology licenses. If the business owner does not have a cosmetology license, the manager of the shop must have a license and at least 2 years of experience.

It is the responsibility of shop owner to also ensure each staff member is appropriately licensed by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. Licenses are required for cosmetologists, hairstylists, manicurists, skin care specialists, barbers, hair braiders, beauticians, and teacher licenses. If staff do not already have a license, they can obtain a license by taking an exam with the Division of Consumer Affairs.

- Name and address of the school that provided license training

- Your individual license or a manager with a license
- Confirmed your staff have their cosmetology license
