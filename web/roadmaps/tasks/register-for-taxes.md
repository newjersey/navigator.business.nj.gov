Now that you formed your business, you need to file for taxes with the State.

It's time to register your business for State taxes with the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services. Doing so will tell the State more about your business and determine what taxes you're liable for. The form you will be filing for this task is often referred to as NJ-Reg.

To complete this application, you must have:
- `Entity ID|entity-id` (not required for general partnership or sole proprietorship)
- `NAICS code|naics`
- `EIN|ein`
- Estimated number of employees
- Estimated start date

After you complete this task, you will have:
- NJ Tax ID
- Authorization to Collect Sales Tax
