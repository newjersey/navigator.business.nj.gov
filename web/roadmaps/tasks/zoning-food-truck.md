Your local government may have licensing, sign permits and zoning requirements. Check with the zoning office at the location where youâ€™re interested in parking your food truck. You will need to do this for every location where you intend to operate your business. 
 
Food trucks need to be cleaned and sanitized according to Department of Health guidelines. The truck can be stored wherever the local zoning ordinance allows for the overnight storage of the vehicle. **Before parking a truck in a residential neighborhood, be sure to check with your municipal zoning officer**
