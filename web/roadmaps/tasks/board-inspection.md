Now that the Division of Consumer Affairs reviwed your shop license application and confirmed all materials were submitted, you need to have the site inspected. 

To complete your requirements as a cosmetology business, an inspector from the New Jersey Division's Enforcement Bureau will visit the shop location to determine compliance. Read the [cosmetology shop regulations](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/regulations/Chapter-28-Board-of-Cosmetology-and-Hairstyling.pdf)to make sure you are prepared. The Board will contact your shop to schedule an inspection after your shop license application is complete.

After you complete this task, you will have:
- A cosmetology shop license
