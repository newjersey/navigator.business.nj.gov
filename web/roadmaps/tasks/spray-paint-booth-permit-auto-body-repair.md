If your business will offer spray paint services to vehicles, you must speak with a representative at the Office of Permitting and Project Navigation at the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Below we list a few permits DEP may require from your business:
**Air Permitting**: due to potential chemicals spray paint emits
**Hazardous Waste**: related to potential paint solvents and material waste
**New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES)**: caused by potential discharge water from your facility
**Wetlands, Existing Flood Hazard Areas**: related to potential disturbances caused by your business
**Right to Know**: due to what is being stored on the site

Speak to DEP's Office of Permitting and Project Navigation at (609)292-3600 for additional guidance.
