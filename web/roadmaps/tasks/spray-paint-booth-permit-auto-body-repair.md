If your business will offer spray paint services to vehicles, you must speak with a representative at the Office of Permitting and Project Navigation at the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Below we list a few permits DEP may require from your business:
* Air Permitting: due to potential chemicals spray paint emits
* Hazardous Waste: related to potential paint solvents and material waste
* New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES): caused by potential discharge water from your facility
* Wetlands, Existing Flood Hazard Areas: related to potential disturbances caused by your business
* Right to Know: due to what is being stored on the site
